9/14/2019,"Should note that these product mix & logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK & Ireland right now, but we don't raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win.",77,49,782

7/6/2018,Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network & inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof & auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.,1275,4067,20338
