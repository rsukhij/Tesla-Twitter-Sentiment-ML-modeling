7/14/20,Wow
7/13/20,Reusability is essential. A rocket that is single use is just as absurd as a single use airplane. F9 engines already fire 3 times per flight.
7/13/20,Wild times!
7/13/20,We’re being extra paranoid. Maximizing probability of successful launch is paramount.
7/13/20,Welcome anytime
7/13/20,"Well, I do care very much about sustainability of civilization, but there is some truth to the irony part haha"
7/13/20,"Yes, in plan. Superchargers and public high power wall connectors will keep growing exponentially every year."
7/13/20,👀
7/13/20,I think so
7/13/20,"Doing range testing now. Number will be significantly higher than 300. Extremely good for any EV, especially an SUV."
7/13/20,"We have reduced pricing on Model Y LR dual motor & will offer a LR single motor Y in a few months, which improves affordability, while still keeping the product excellent"
7/13/20,Yes
7/13/20,It may be able to reach 250kW at low states of charge
7/13/20,"No, as range would be unacceptably low (< 250 mile EPA)"
7/13/20,"We had to increase some wire thicknesses in S/X to reduce resistive heating. Technically, won’t be quite 1000 mph charging, as X especially is much bigger than 3."
7/13/20,Hell of a ride!
7/12/20,Thanks :)
7/12/20,That is the near-term danger of AI
7/12/20,I didn’t mind DA2. DA1 was awesome. Mass Effect 2 (talking about sequels) is amazing.

7/10/20,"Wow, IHOP & GitHub are close"
7/10/20,Best use of the term “Full Stack”?
7/10/20,For sure. This is both great & terrifying. Everything we’ve ever sensed or thought has been electrical signals. The early universe was just a soup of quarks & leptons. How did a very small piece of the Universe start to think of itself as sentient?
7/10/20,Yes
7/10/20,"Sorry, should hopefully be soon!"
7/10/20,"Not actually a payout, just a vesting of stock options. It may never pay out, as the stock can’t be sold for 5 years after exercise. The stock must be bought & income taxes paid, then hold value for 5 years."

7/4/20,That would be great
7/4/20,"Agreed, but it’s hard to ignore what is effectively a social media denial of service attack"

7/2/20,"Tesla, as a side project, is building RNA microfactories for CureVac & possibly others"
7/2/20,"In principle, I think synthetic RNA (and DNA) has amazing potential. This basically makes the solution to many diseases a software problem."
7/2/20,"As you’d expect, this has resulted in a proportionately very high number of C19 false positives. Field test reliability we are seeing is best case 5%, worst case 50% false positive. Much worse than lab accuracy."

6/29/20,"There are a ridiculous number of false positive C19 tests, in some cases ~50%. False positives scale linearly with # of tests. This is a big part of why C19 positive tests are going up while hospitalizations & mortality are declining. Anyone who tests positive should retest."

6/25/20,"Exactly! A carbon tax is needed to correct the unpriced externality & market will do the rest. The consequences of slow action are serious. In my opinion, we need to convert >80% of the global road, sea & air fleet to renewables by 2050."

6/23/20,Will be changed to $3k until July 1st
6/22/20,Yes
6/22/20,Yes
6/22/20,Tentative date for Tesla Shareholder Meeting & Battery Day is Sept 15. Will include tour of cell production system.

6/21/20,"This would be a good time to upgrade to FSD, as it goes up by $1k on July 1. We could make it $7k to upgrade to FSD until July 1 (even if you don’t have basic Autopilot). Does that sound good?"
6/21/20,This does sound excessive. Will look into it.
6/21/20,"Just us being fools, but free Supercharging forever is not coming back to any vehicles. It’s not a good incentive structure."

6/21/20,Bought based on your review. It’s great!

6/21/20,"For example, we created a chip design team from scratch for the Tesla full self-driving computer, which is not something car companies do"
6/21/20,"Tesla should really be thought of as roughly a dozen technology startups, many of which have little to no correlation with traditional automotive companies"
6/21/20,We are putting a lot of effort into improving the Tesla China experience with local engineering & great feedback from Tesla owners in China!
6/21/20,"Cool, lmk what we can do to improve the product, especially vehicle software/firmware, app & overall interaction with Tesla, as these changes can immediately improve the entire fleet"
6/20/20,Feels so long ago
6/20/20,Pulling up to The Petersen

6/20/20,It will look a little odd
6/20/20,Probably Fremont
6/20/20,"Probably good to combine them, since they are converging in time. I’m hopeful we can announce a date after the July 4th week."
6/20/20,"Yes, but we will have to postpone annual shareholder meeting, as still no large gatherings allowed by July 7th. Not sure of new date, but am guessing maybe a month or so later."
6/20/20,Stop by The Petersen is you’d like to see Cybertruck irl! Lots of awesome cars & bikes there. Definitely worth seeing with or without Cybertruck.

6/16/20,It will be real
6/16/20,Maybe Incat https://mashable.com/2013/06/29/worlds-fastest-ship-jet-engines-francisco/ …
6/16/20,There will be many test flights before commercial passengers are carried. First Earth to Earth test flights might be in 2 or 3 years.
6/16/20,We need to be far enough away so as not to bother heavily populated areas. The launch & landing are not subtle. But you could get within a few miles of the spaceport in a boat.
6/16/20,"Directionally correct, but Zenit is an order of magnitude smaller than Starship system & doesn’t come back & land"
6/16/20,"US law requires at least a green card to be hired at SpaceX, as rockets are considered advanced weapons technology"
6/16/20,Pretty much

6/16/20,"Actually, we’ve made slight changes, but the range improvement is >90% efficiency"
6/16/20,Cool
6/16/20,Physics doesn’t care about politicians
6/16/20,Coming soon
6/16/20,All Model S cars made since late Jan have 402 mile range. This is just making it official.

6/15/20,Looking likely
6/15/20,"Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox & fuel turbopump injector preburner “stiffness”, essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out."
6/15/20,"Tank didn’t burst, but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result & supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. We’re developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable."
6/15/20,"Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that’s already mixed."
6/15/20,Yes
6/15/20,"That’s the goal. There a few known weak points on this test tank, probably capable of more pressure. The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points."
6/15/20,Accurate
6/15/20,Sure
6/15/20,"Around 20ms. It’s designed to run real-time, competitive video games. Version 2, which is at lower altitude could be as low as 8ms latency."
6/14/20,It will get even simpler. Just two instructions for Starlink: plug in & point at sky. Can be done in either order.
6/14/20,Congratulations Kathy!

6/11/20,"Exactly. Chartering a dedicated 747 flight around the world costs less than buying a small, single engine turboprop plane. In the same way, a giant reusable rocket flight is way cheaper than a tiny expendable rocket that can be used only once."
6/11/20,TRUE
6/11/20,"Battery industry is world champion at bs. “Lithium-ion” doesn’t really mean anything. What matters is cathode & anode material. There are many choices, but nickel cathode with carbon-silicon anode works great."

6/10/20,"Hundreds of improvements in manufacturability primarily (this is by far the hardest problem), mass down, thrust up, Isp up. Current improvement list continues past SN50. As the saying goes, it’s 1% inspiration & 99% perspiration …"
6/10/20,"Also, insulation of a deep cryogen( which I’d call anything that liquifies nitrogen aka 78% of air) is heavy & prone to heat leaks. H2 is hell."
6/10/20,Tesla factory workplace safety is 5% better than industry average for manufacturers & improving fast pic.twitter.com/axmInA9fZb
6/10/20,"Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) & significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2."
6/10/20,"We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach >99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is ~97% on a good day & requires desooting of turbines between flights."

6/10/20,"Combined with SpaceX deep subcooling of propellants to near liquefaction temp of N2, use of common dome (CH4 & O2 liquid at similar temps) & higher T/W of engines enables de facto higher delta-V than an H2/O2 stage"
6/10/20,"Quite a piece! I should credit Soviet/Russian engine work in the 80’s as being a factor in deciding to switch from H2 to CH4. They demonstrated excellent performance on test stands, with Isp up to 380 secs."

6/10/20,Good point!
6/10/20,Yes
6/10/20,(Formerly) mainstream media has systemic negative & political bias about almost everything. Reading major newspapers makes you feel sad & angry. That’s why they’re being crushed by @joerogan.

6/8/20,"Forward thrusters are to stabilize ship when landing in high winds. If goal is max payload to moon per ship, no heatshield or flaps or big gas thruster packs are needed. No need to bring early ships back. They can serve as part of moon base alpha."
6/8/20,Absolutely
6/8/20,"Outcome-based contracting with multiple competitors is vastly better than cost-plus (especially if sole-sourced), as the former rewards results & latter rewards waste. Outcome contracting should be applied broadly within government. The difference in results will be incredible."

6/4/20,That’s when all life on Earth will be boiled off. What matters is how long civilization is capable of making the jump to Mars. This could be a very short period of time measured in decades. It took 4.5 billion years to get to this point & civilization isn’t looking super stable.

5/11/20,Thanks for the cool suggestions 😀❤️👍 More fun coming to your Tesla soon! https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256856981177987072 …
5/11/20,For real

5/11/20,"No, I just think you’re a boring idiot"
5/11/20,Message received
5/11/20,This thread summarizes situation perfectly
5/11/20,Sheriff Bianco rocks!
5/10/20,They were amazing
5/10/20,"Absolutely. Moreover, they don’t even need to be tested for covid, just need “covid-like symptoms”, which is a long list, including “feeling weakness”. Hard to die *without* feeling weakness!"
5/10/20,Georgia lifted lockdown 15 days ago
5/10/20,He is right
5/10/20,We are a pattern of atoms
5/10/20,Pretty much
5/10/20,Exactly
5/10/20,SN4 passed high pressure (7.5 bar) & engine thrust load at cryo

5/9/20,"I’m not messing around. Absurd & medically irrational behavior in violation of constitutional civil liberties, moreover by *unelected* county officials with no accountability, needs to stop."
5/9/20,"Much appreciated, Mayor Fine!"
5/9/20,Thanks Mayor Mei! http://www.fremont.gov/CivicAlerts/SingleAlertItem?alertID=1768 …
5/9/20,Absolutely
5/9/20,Please voice your disagreement as strongly as possible with @AlamedaCounty
5/9/20,"Yes, already done"
5/9/20,Yes
5/9/20,Tesla is the biggest manufacturer in California & second biggest exporter
5/9/20,Exactly! Tesla knows far more about what needs to be done to be safe through our Tesla China factory experience than an (unelected) interim junior official in Alameda County.
5/9/20,"Absolutely, please do! You should be allowed to recoup damages from the county."
5/9/20,"San Joaquin County, right next door to Alameda, has been sensible & reasonable, whereas Alameda has been irrational & detached from reality. Our castings foundry and other faculties in San Joaquin have been working 24/7 this entire time with no ill effects. Same with Giga Nevada."
5/9/20,"Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA."
5/9/20,"Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately. The unelected & ignorant “Interim Health Officer” of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms & just plain common sense!"
5/9/20,"No, I have a license!"
5/9/20,B-nut 🤣

5/8/20,Glad we could help
5/8/20,It’s true
5/8/20,Coming soon
5/8/20,"Yes, this is a high priority"
5/8/20,"Operating on a prime directive of crash avoidance, it could automatically intervene when crash probability is approaching 100%"
5/8/20,"Pain can certainly be turned off, but we’re not sure what the best initial test case (max goodness for least risk to patient) would be quite yet"
5/8/20,Teslas automatically maintain their internal temperature to within safe limits in case a pet or child is left in the car
5/8/20,That’s harder than it sounds. Will check with team.
5/8/20,Ok
5/8/20,!
5/8/20,"No, but it’s mostly the same as the ship, except for the thrust bulkhead (31 engines vs 6)"
5/8/20,"It’s not all about engineering, although that is my personal favorite. Striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal."
5/8/20,"To be clear, I do think finance & law are important, but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also, too many MBAs."
5/8/20,"Yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case)"
5/8/20,Would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of Mars
5/8/20,"Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 & 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg."
5/7/20,🤣🤣
5/7/20,"That’s pretty much what happened. The cows weren’t sure what to do (not having encountered a rocket before), so first ran one direction, then the other."
5/7/20,A mandatory tracing app would be insane
5/7/20,TRUE
5/7/20,Probably makes sense to have a “Details” section of the app that mirrors everything in the car. Would also allow phone to be used in lieu of car screen if car screen faults for any reason.
5/7/20,Franz and I do have absurdly similar tastes 🤣🤣
5/7/20,Would cover latitude of London
5/7/20,Yes
5/7/20,"Peak rate of about half that for version 1 is about right, but heavily dependent on users per cell. Aiming for latency under 20 ms."
5/7/20,"It will only work for higher latitudes (Seattle) at first, then get progressively closer to the equator"
5/7/20,Sure :)
5/7/20,Way more important than it sounds
5/7/20,Yeah!!
5/7/20,"A fully & rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth. Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc."
5/7/20,SLS makes me feel sad
5/7/20,"No, they will be smashed beyond repair & corroded"
5/7/20,"Yeah, although hydrogen is not a great choice for a booster engine"
5/7/20,A great mystery of the universe
5/7/20,It’s so tragic that these engines just crash into the ocean every flight
5/7/20,"Roundabouts no problem, but dodging distracted human drivers very tricky!"
5/7/20,"Looks about right. Ice mining/refining  on Mars & maximizing total system efficiency will be hard. CO2 is easy, as Mars atmosphere is mostly that. Also has good amount of N2, which is important for life."
5/7/20,"In this case, just chilling the gas back to liquid"
5/7/20,"Yes, converts CO2 & H2O to CH4 & O2. Perfect for Mars!  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier_reaction …"
5/7/20,"Flare stack flamed out. In a few weeks we’ll be recondensing methane using solar power, so no flare stack."
5/7/20,Turns on city street intersections is the big one
5/7/20,Yes. Static fire feeding from fuel header vs main tank.
5/7/20,Not SpaceX
5/7/20,His son sounds great btw
5/7/20,2008 was a super tough year on all levels
5/7/20,"Tesla & SpaceX are the top two destinations for engineers, because you can have the most fun creating kickass technology! That’s why."
5/6/20,Good for them! About half the US will be mostly open by this weekend.

5/6/20,Hopefully so
5/6/20,What’s wild is that Super Heavy will have 31 Raptor engines in same space!
5/6/20,"It’s true, the pressure bulkheads are too pointy"
5/6/20,Starship SN4 passed static fire
5/6/20,"Happy, healthy & cute as a button :)"
5/6/20,This person is wrong. Why does JD want to believe he got cucked so bad anyway!?
5/5/20,There would be time-stamped video if this were true
5/5/20,Should be a lot of fun!
5/5/20,There are many pieces to the puzzle
5/5/20,DKE in a nutshell: we’re almost always dumber than we think we are
5/5/20,"Science is simply rigorous pursuit of truth. Quality of reasoning is all that matters, which means a ten-year-old could be more correct than a physics Nobel Prize winner."
5/5/20,That would be awesome
5/5/20,"This is false. JD’s team put out “video evidence”, but conveniently excluded the date stamp, as it was well after JD & AH had separated."
5/5/20,"Yeah, definitely a future feature"
5/5/20,Levitt rocks
5/5/20,"Important to distinguish died with covid vs died because of covid. Also, distinguish between tested positive for covid or only had symptoms."

5/4/20,Weird that EPA would deny this. We have precise car logs that confirm it happened. Happy to provide them.
5/4/20,I hope anything lands
5/4/20,It seems unlikely right now
5/4/20,Mostly accurate. Liquid CH4 temp got too high this time. Offloading propellant. Will we retry later today.

5/4/20,Good chance it accelerates viral vaccines & cures
5/4/20,True 🤣🤣
5/4/20,What’s troubling is that this doesn’t get humanity a base on the moon or even a small crewed Mars mission

5/3/20,"Yes, about a month away from testing Raptor Vacuum"
5/3/20,"A little. Will have 31 engines, not 37, no big fins and legs similar to ship. That thrust dome is the super hard part. Raptor SL thrust starts at 200 ton, but upgrades in the works for 250 ton."
5/3/20,Anyone think they can get a good multiplayer Minecraft working on Teslas? Or maybe create a game that interacts virtually with reality like Pokémon Go while driving safely? Like a complex version of Pac-man or Mario Kart?
5/3/20,Minecraft has amazing legs

4/25/20,"No, good chance of RUD (rapid unscheduled disassembly) event, but landing pad is separated from launch pad"
4/25/20,That basically describes SoC 0 vs SoC 1 of our FSD computer right now. Soon to change!
4/25/20,So often true 🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/qxmDtZ4Buf
4/25/20,Improved process I was referring to was cylinder to cylinder circumferential welds to improve cycle time & reduce pucker. Those are still working their way through production.
4/25/20,These won’t be strictly coupled to ship serial number. Might be on SN5 or might just be used as a manufacturing pathfinder.
4/25/20,Great labeling tools & talented human labelers really matter. It really is a skilled profession! Importance of good tools & infrastructure is underrated.
4/25/20,"As usual for most things, building production system for Raptor is >1000% harder than designing it"
4/25/20,It’s also because of the Spitfire engine & wizard
4/25/20,Pretty much. Being better than human drivers on average is not a super high standard. Autonomy will probably be held to a 300% to 1000% higher safety requirement long-term.
4/25/20,Progress is good
4/25/20,Definitely
4/25/20,Many talented engineers are working on FSD at Tesla. What matters is solving vision at high frame rate in our compute space with low latency between camera frame & actuation.
4/25/20,"Sure, we can probably do an update later this year"
4/25/20,Needs to be more than halfway to east coast
4/25/20,"Not saying new Giga will be in Texas, but Cybertruck will be produced there wherever it is, as Fremont is at max capacity"

4/22/20,"Frankly, much of the stimulus money is questionable, but this much to oil & gas seems especially so"
4/22/20,Not the greatest use of money
4/22/20,"If this launch succeeds, we will have put up 422 satellites …"
4/22/20,Thanks! We are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness btw. Should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle & all sats get sunshades starting with launch 9.
4/22/20,Makes sense
4/22/20,Nice
4/22/20,Anything surprising?
4/22/20,Numbers I was told from Wuhan were 80% to 90% mortality rate for invasive ventilators. Those are not good odds.
4/22/20,"When I talked to doctors in Wuhan, they recommended against invasive ventilators & in favor of non-invasive"
4/22/20,No kidding …
4/21/20,Good article
4/21/20,"Am in Boca working on the rocket with an awesome team, so pretty great :)"
4/21/20,🤣🤣

4/20/20,Yes. It will even float for a while.

4/19/20,"SpaceX has a lot of experience berthing & now docking with @Space_Station, which is very difficult. Orbital refilling should in theory be easier, since Starships dock with themselves & will be uncrewed at first."
4/19/20,Great platform 🤣🤣
4/19/20,!!
4/19/20,"Fully reusable orbital rocket, then orbital refilling, then Mars"
4/19/20,10% would be impressive. Anything below a 20% payload hit would be outstanding.
4/19/20,"I sure hope so! This will inspire the world & get people excited about the future, just as Apollo did. It wasn’t just that a few people went to the moon, they went there for all humankind."
4/19/20,"Another reason reported mortality rate is overstated is that dying *with* covid is not same as dying *from* covid. Media keeps reporting former, not latter."
4/19/20,Maybe 1.5% change to interior dimensions. Still very roomy.
4/19/20,Probably 3 to 6 months
4/19/20,"Moreover, there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid. If they put Boris Johnson on mask ventilator, but *not* invasive, that tells you something! This article incorrectly conflates invasive as “ventilator”, but makes many good points https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8230775/Is-proof-live-saving-ventilators-actually-deathtraps.html …"
4/19/20,"You’d think they’d at least be Wikipedia-level informed about ventilators! It clearly articulates the difference between invasive & non-invasive. It’s very misleading to the public to claim that only the invasive type are “real ventilators”.

4/18/20,"Raptor is going through many development tests. Merlin is doing acceptance tests, as the design is stable. Depending on how you count them, there are about 6 engine stands operating in parallel."

4/16/20,.@GavinNewsom please fix this misunderstanding
4/16/20,Exactly
4/16/20,What I find most surprising is that CNN still exists
4/16/20,“Dr. Levitan advocates combining breathing support from a CPAP machine or regular oxygen with comfortable positioning”. Yup.
4/16/20,“Don’t jump to intubation.” — Dr Caputo https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1250205685868122115 …
4/16/20,"A mask or nose “ventilator” with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation & you’re fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable."
4/16/20,Sounds about right https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2020-04-15/are-ventilators-helping-or-harming-covid-19-patients …
4/16/20,Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I’m hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic?
4/16/20,"I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked, one in NYC and one in Arlington"
4/16/20,We’re working super hard on getting traffic lights & stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year.
4/16/20,"They were, but are they currently?"
4/16/20,Interesting
4/16/20,"We are hearing almost all hospital ICUs have excess capacity. In some cases, 60% empty."
4/16/20,Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.
4/16/20,Sure
4/16/20,"Production is by *far* the hard part. That’s why I’m not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they’re pretty sweet …"
4/16/20,"SN4 won’t get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator & static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps."
4/16/20,That’s for sure! 😅
4/16/20,I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It’s very hard. I’m spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done 😀
4/16/20,My (again) personal favorite is https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/japanese-flu-drug-clearly-effective-in-treating-coronavirus-says-china …
4/16/20,"Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially @rocketlab. Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn’t scale to bigger rockets & is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it’s probably right move for small LEO vehicle."
4/16/20,"Vast majority of “ventilators” are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient’s throat & driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2. https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2020-04-15/are-ventilators-helping-or-harming-covid-19-patients …"
4/16/20,SN26
4/16/20,"Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It’s a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!"
4/16/20,"The way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!"
4/16/20,"Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch"
4/16/20,"Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage & payload separation system also not US."
4/16/20,"Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips & Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation & setting PEEP & O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage. pic.twitter.com/2IUnS5DPOg"
4/16/20,"Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet 100%."
4/16/20,"Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated!"
4/16/20,"Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!"
4/16/20,"Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often & is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing."
4/16/20,"Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That’s the acid test."
4/16/20,"True. Only reason other medium & heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, they’d be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying."
4/15/20,"To be clear, Fremont & Shanghai will also be upgraded over time, but it’s hard to retrofit these improvements to an operating paint shop"
4/14/20,Initial production at Giga Berlin is Model Y
4/14/20,You will be able to wrap it in any color or pattern
4/14/20,"There’s tough competition for that title, but we will give it our best shot!"
4/14/20,"Giga Berlin will have world’s most advanced paint shop, with more layers of stunning colors that subtly change with curvature"
4/13/20,This will happen
4/13/20,We stole that from cheetahs
4/13/20,"In case it’s not already obvious, our product plan is basically stolen from Spaceballs"
4/13/20,"There’s a lot to talk about just on the battery front, so, yeah, just that. I guess we could answer some powertrain questions in Q&A."
4/13/20,"Just battery day, but it will be great. Plaid powertrain will be later this year."

4/11/20,Particulate matter from automotive exhausts has a much more serious impact on health than most people realize

3/27/20,"We will give away all our ventilators, whether we buy them or build them"
3/27/20,"Yes. Just as with groceries, the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators, preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed."
3/27/20,"Biggest value Tesla is providing is precise delivery of ventilators exactly to the ICU where & when they’re needed. There are many ventilators in warehouses, but stuck in logistics/routing/paperwork issues."
3/27/20,You’re most welcome. Credit to the Tesla team. Will do our best to help in any way.

3/25/20,Something weird happened at CDC yesterday. They changed the graph to include “estimated illness onset date”. This is a significantly less rigorous standard. pic.twitter.com/Dz2Nio5ddi
3/25/20,C19 testing in the US over the past week has grown much faster than C19 positive cases. I think we may have passed the inflection point for US cases (excluding NY) already.
3/25/20,Yes. Is there more? Should be a lot of data by now.
3/25/20,Making good progress. We will do whatever is needed to help in these difficult times.

3/24/20,"Yup, China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips & Medtronic ventilators on Friday night & airshipped them to LA. If you want a free ventilator installed, please let us know!"
3/24/20,"Yeah, pretty much. House could talk to car & know when you’re expected home, so temp & humidity would be perfect just as you arrive. No wasted energy."
3/24/20,This is a way bigger deal than most people realize
3/24/20,"Sure would love to do home hvac that’s quiet & efficient, with humidity control & HEPA filter"
3/24/20,Yes. PCB design techniques applied to create a heat exchanger that is physically impossible by normal means. Heat pump also has a local heating loop to spool up fast & extend usable temperature range. Octavalve is pretty special too. Team did great work. No credit to me.
3/24/20,The heat pump and rear body castings are a step beyond
3/23/20,Model Y heat pump is some of the best engineering I’ve seen in a while. Team did next-level work.

3/23/20,Worrisome
3/23/20,Yup
3/23/20,We’ll try to get & deliver as many as possible. N95 masks are a pain to wear btw. Less onerous masks are better most of the time.
3/23/20,Yeah. We have a mask shipment stuck at LAX. Hopefully freed up soon.
3/23/20,Nice
3/23/20,This is great advice
3/23/20,Thanks for taking delivery in your garage! Let us know if there’s anything else you need.
3/22/20,"We expect to have over ~1200 to distribute this week. Getting them delivered, installed & operating is the harder part."
3/22/20,Supply chain logistics — getting masks & other PPE to the right places in time  — is the main issue we’re hearing from ER physicians
3/22/20,You’re most welcome. We’re working on getting other types of PPE too. Ventilators should arrive within a few days.
3/22/20,Panic is always dumb

3/21/20,Fair point :)
3/21/20,"Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too. pic.twitter.com/YKMW54q2kL"
3/21/20,Up to 80% false positive
3/21/20,"Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases & using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand."
3/21/20,Do you have data on the false positive rate? I’ve heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and “presumed positive”. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html …

2/10/20,"Tesla April company talk will be from our Giga New York factory, where we make SolarGlass & several other products. Will also offer customer & media tours."
2/10/20,Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It’s stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don’t do it justice.
2/10/20,"Its integrated roof & solar, so should be light enough for almost any home"
2/10/20,Coming hopefully later this year
2/10/20,"I think will still be better than a normal roof, but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice & snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows!"
2/10/20,"No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, it’s very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles."
2/10/20,Sounds should note that it gets less shiny automatically due to dust & weathering. This pic is brand new.
2/10/20,Ok
2/10/20,Sounds like we should open a Tesla Center there!
2/10/20,Please let us know what improvements we can make to any aspect of Tesla SolarGlass roof! Critical feedback is much appreciated.

2/7/20,You’re welcome! Was a fun recruiting event. Great to see all the excitement about helping build Starships.
2/7/20,"Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be <2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter."
2/7/20,"No, they’re SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time."
2/7/20,"Yes, we’re tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering & building a heavy duty planisher to flatten & cold work the weld area"
2/7/20,"That said, although substantial capital & engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it’s built inside a factory in volume."
2/7/20,"This isn’t quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that’s 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures & welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving."

2/3/20,"First, we need to make it super safe & easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production & implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards."
2/3/20,"Ok sure 😀 Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldn’t be thought of as USA only. Also, work location can be Bay Area (preferred), but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory."

2/3/20,"Our NN is initially in Python for rapid iteration, then converted to C++/C/raw metal driver code for speed (important!). Also, tons of C++/C engineers needed for vehicle control & entire rest of car. Educational background is irrelevant, but all must pass hardcore coding test."
2/3/20,"The profound impact of high bandwidth, high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. Just needs to be unequivocally better than Utah Array, which is already in some humans & has severe drawbacks."
2/3/20,Sorry!
2/2/20,A PhD is definitely not required. All that matters is a deep understanding of AI & ability to implement NNs in a way that is actually useful (latter point is what’s truly hard). Don’t care if you even graduated high school.
2/2/20,"Not needed, but will be very useful on Mars due to light speed latency"
2/2/20,Tesla will hold a super fun AI party/hackathon at my house with the Tesla AI/autopilot team in about four weeks. Invitations going out soon.

1/16/20,"What’s amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity."
1/16/20,"Densification isn’t needed to return the ship & limited cargo from Mars, but it’s an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed"
1/16/20,"Fundamental issue with SLS is that it’s not reusable, which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch! 💯 tragedy."
1/16/20,"Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!"

1/15/20,Just saw this today. Tesla refunds in general should be easy to get electronically & certainly through customer service. Will he addressed.
1/14/20,"Very true. What’s really mindblowing is how much energy the sun outputs & how little of it is absorbed by Earth. There is sooo much solar energy. We can solar power all of human civilization with a tiny % of Earth’s surface, which is a super tiny % of energy emitted by the sun."
1/14/20,"Advancing humanity’s understanding of the Universe is a fundamental motivator for SpaceX! Starship can put giant 🔭 in orbit & on moon. With an occluder, could image 🌏 in other star systems."
1/14/20,One person’s MRI machine is another’s railgun! Made a primitive one when I was studying physics at Penn. Hard to wield though.
1/14/20,"Exactly. We’ve had good discussions with leading astronomers. One way or another, we’ll make sure Starlink doesn’t inhibit new discoveries or change the character of the night sky."

1/14/20,Thanks for mentioning! We should’ve done this ages ago.
1/13/20,"Good analysis, although a bit conservative imo. However, using a high upper bound for land area that’s *still* a tiny % of the US prob helps convert some naysayers. That giant fusion reactor in the sky called the sun outputs a truly staggering amount of energy!"

1/11/20,Yes
1/10/20,Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank — it’s just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don’t collapse when depressurized on the ground.
1/10/20,"Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4."
1/10/20,A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps & pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
1/10/20,"Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts & better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight."

12/30/19,"Many ways to solve this problem, but the power requirements are much higher than aircraft control surfaces. When moving giant body flaps rapidly, achieving high power is much harder than high torque."

12/30/19,"Also, I hate deeply nested classes in C++. Had to be said."
12/30/19,"The less code, the better! 1 point for adding a line of code, but 2 points for deleting a line. Bloatware is the devil."
12/30/19,"Direct drive using several Tesla Plaid motors in parallel for SN1. Simpler, lighter & more fault tolerant. Rear flaps each need ~1.5 megawatts. It’s like moving the entire wing of an aircraft!"
12/30/19,"Tesla merch def needs some love, but too many fish to fry rn"
12/30/19,Coming …
12/30/19,Tesla uses that to wirebond cells to module current collectors. Is there a commercially available machine that can weld ~4mm full hard 301 stainless barrels & domes?
12/30/19,We’re focusing on Boca right now for Starship & Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon
12/30/19,Spin start from COPVs so the ox & fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.
12/30/19,"Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc & steel melt pool."
12/30/19,"No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 & O2 from Raptor"
12/30/19,Yeah
12/30/19,"Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts & fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020."
12/30/19,"Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed & TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints & 20% mass reduction."
12/30/19,"We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome."
12/30/19,Almost three now. Boca team is crushing it! Starship has giant dome 🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/qTN2TU02pb

12/30/19,"Crew Dragon is capable of propulsive landing, but would require extensive testing to prove safety. Better to focus on Starship."
12/30/19,"New technology development schedules tend to exhibit a version of Zeno’s Paradox — at any given point, you’re halfway there"
12/30/19,"Crew Dragon should be physically ready & at the Cape in Feb, but completing all safety reviews will probably take a few more months"
12/30/19,"8 years later, the simulation is mostly real"
12/30/19,Amazing work by Tesla China team!! ❤️❤️

12/30/19,"I def believe in the ethical treatment of animals & taking action of climate, but these are mostly separate moral issues"
12/30/19,Nice
12/30/19,"Renewable energy production (solar, wind, geothermal), improving home insulation & electric transport will do the trick. Vegan/vegetarian helps a little, but isn’t critical. We should take the set of actions that maximize total public happiness!"
12/30/19,Ok
12/30/19,"I support people choosing whatever diet makes them happy, but it’s true that everyone going vegan still wouldn’t stop climate change. Moving billions of tons of hydrocarbons from deep underground into the atmosphere & oceans is fundamentally the issue."

12/29/19,"Certainly worth trying! The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don’t try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever."
12/29/19,"Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else & directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them."
12/29/19,Pretty much
12/29/19,Sure. Trax will get much better & more fun. This is an alpha version.
12/29/19,"No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic & it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is."
12/29/19,"That might have something to do with it. “Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar” was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they’d listened to Lenin’s last wish, much tragedy may have been averted."
12/29/19,"For sure, but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well. A sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net."
12/29/19,Thousands of anon/troll/bot accounts suddenly on the attack. Interesting.
12/29/19,❤️ you too sis

12/29/19,Sounds like a Marxist with style
12/29/19,Exactly
12/29/19,"Induced demand is one of the most irrational theories I’ve ever heard. Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone."
12/28/19,"This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was 17 with just a backpack & suitcase of books. Worked on my Mom’s cousin’s farm in Saskatchewan & a lumber mill in Vancouver. Went to Queens Univ with scholarship & debt, then same to UPenn/Wharton & Stanford."
12/28/19,"This person blocked me, so can’t read the tweet. Whats their deal?"
12/28/19,"We started Zip2 with ~$2k from me plus my overclocked home-built PC, ~$5k from my bro & ~$8k from Greg Kouri (such a good guy — he is greatly missed).

My Dad provided 10% of a ~$200k angel funding round much later, but by then risk was reduced & round would’ve happened anyway."
12/28/19,"He didn’t own an emerald mine & I worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt. I couldn’t even afford a 2nd PC at Zip2, so programmed at night & website only worked during day. Where is this bs coming from?"
12/28/19,Pretty much
12/28/19,Federal
12/28/19,Probably 2021. Depends on regulatory approvals.
12/28/19,Hopefully working in Caribbean by end of 2020. Def by 2021.
12/28/19,"Maximizing conversion of mass to aimed photons (pure momentum) is actually the highest possible efficiency, which is why an antimatter drive is probably the best way to get to other star systems with known physics. For “close” stars, a laser sail is good too."
12/28/19,"Yes, but it’s too secret"
12/28/19,Hopefully fully operational in 2020
12/28/19,"Boring Co is completing its first commercial tunnel in Vegas, going from Convention Center to Strip, then will work on other projects"
12/28/19,"No, he’s still much faster 🐌"
12/28/19,"These would be road tunnels for zero emissions vehicles only — no toxic fumes is the key. Really, just an underground road, but limited to EVs (from all auto companies). This is not in place of other solutions, eg light rail, but supplemental to them."

12/26/19,The overarching goal of Tesla engineering is maximize area under user happiness curve
12/26/19,"It’s not that these things can’t be done, they just absorb a lot of software engineering time, which has great opportunity cost. There are very few excellent software engineers & merely increasing team size results in awful bloatware."
12/26/19,Future feature
12/26/19,"Turn on auto navigate feature & car will activate traffic-based navigation to work, home or calendar, depending on context, as soon as you sit down. No input required at all."
12/26/19,"Possible, but one step at a time. Anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. For example, if someone’s on data roaming & video is enabled, they will get a giant cell phone bill. Operating in 40+ countries results in many corner cases!"
12/26/19,"Seeing B pillar (diagonal fwd) & side repeater (diagonal back) camera views would probably help for tight situations. We can enable access to these views. Also, no problem to have option to disable auto lock for home."
12/26/19,We’re building out Superchargers as fast as possible! Need to ramp V3 Supercharger production.
12/26/19,Phone notification with ability to view possibly relevant still images is no problem. Live video from several cameras is too much bandwidth.
12/26/19,Most people still don’t know it’s there
12/26/19,"Just swipe down on Tesla nav button for car to automatically navigate to home, work or destination in calendar"
12/26/19,"If you enter a longer distance than range, system should autonav to optimal Superchargers along the way. Is it not doing this correctly?"

12/22/19,Ok sure
12/22/19,Sorry for the delay on V2.X! We just couldn’t get it all done in time.
12/22/19,"Unfortunately, this has been necessary for many years, but hopefully not forever"

12/11/19,That’s the one!
12/10/19,It really does
12/10/19,"They smashed the window to steal the radio, which was worth maybe $20. Got a replacement from junkyard. Btw, great deals available from junkyards! It’s pretty fun fixing/upgrading cars."
12/10/19,"Yeah, 1978 320i that I bought in ‘93 for $1400. I hotrodded it by jamming in a 5 speed transmission from a later model I found in a Philly junkyard when the 4 speed transmission failed."
12/10/19,"Couldn’t afford to pay for repairs, so I fixed almost everything on that car from parts in the junkyard. Ironically, that’s me replacing broken side window glass. The circle is complete lol."
12/10/19,Maybe on Starship? It’s def got the payload capacity …
12/10/19,Just wish Russ Mitchell would improve the *quality* of his fiction. Is this too much to ask!?
12/9/19,"Yeah, it’s one of my favorite T-shirts!"
12/8/19,"We’ll aim to have it come out same time as truck. Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We won’t do road bikes, as too dangerous. I was hit by a truck & almost died on one when I was 17."
12/7/19,Your Twitter comments are great btw!
12/7/19,Huge thanks to everyone who contributed ideas to Cybertruck. It’s better because of you! ♥️♥️♥️
12/7/19,"This may sound crazy, but asking real people what they’d like in a product is a great way to meet their needs"
12/7/19,There will be no loss of either
12/7/19,"That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width"
12/7/19,"True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages."
12/7/19,We can prob reduce width by an inch & maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.

12/1/19,Laminar air flow due to a completely smooth bottom is underappreciated
12/1/19,That’s why Cybertruck has active suspension height & damping control

11/24/19,"We’re creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we’ll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can’t be made using standard methods."
11/24/19,"Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger."
11/24/19,"Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made"
11/24/19,"Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can’t stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press"

11/8/19,Yes
11/8/19,Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
11/8/19,"SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle & no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year."
11/8/19,"Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!"
11/8/19,Pretty much
11/8/19,"Exactly! It’s also a far more exciting & inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far)."
11/8/19,"No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous & difficult than Earth & take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That’s the sales pitch. Want to go?"
11/7/19,"So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable"
11/7/19,As the planets align only once every two years
11/7/19,A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
11/7/19,No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what’s hard.
11/7/19,"Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half"
11/7/19,"If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles & each does 100 tons to orbit, that’s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year"
11/7/19,"Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it’s designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year"
11/7/19,The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars

11/6/19,"The audience of entrepreneurs should try it, not the AF"
11/6/19,Naturally
11/6/19,This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called “Pitch Day” & I happened to mention Cybertruck. They don’t buy APCs. It’s the Air Force.
11/5/19,Fair point. Coming soon. We’re making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. 2FA right after that.
11/5/19,"Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software."
11/5/19,More to come
11/5/19,Yes
11/5/19,Would be odd to expect anything else
11/4/19,"That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth"
11/4/19,"Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days & requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours & ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed."
11/4/19,Great poem
11/4/19,"Great work by SpaceX Dragon team & Airborne! To be clear, we’ve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row. https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1191067348914098176 …"

10/24/19,Sure
10/24/19,But actually … pic.twitter.com/XJNjPHrq2A
10/23/19,Super proud of Tesla team for great execution & support of Tesla customers greatly appreciated!!
10/23/19,"Tesla Q3 results:

- Shanghai Giga ahead of schedule
- Model Y ahead of schedule
- Solar installs +48% from Q2
- GAAP profitable
- Positive free cash flow"
10/23/19,The big rear wing is only on for one day for rear downforce calibration. Isn’t needed to set ring record & won’t be in the production car.
10/23/19,"Internal camera isn’t used yet (meant for robotaxi), but that’s a good idea"
10/23/19,Please lmk about your experience and what can be improved
10/22/19,Coming soon
10/22/19,"Whoa, it worked!!"
10/22/19,Sending this tweet through space via Starlink satellite 🛰
10/22/19,"Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow https://www.zillow.com/research/solar-panels-house-sell-more-23798/ …"
10/22/19,"More carrot, less stick"
10/21/19,"Very likely that a home with clean power that’s lower cost than utility, plus blackout protection via Powerwall, will have a positive effect on value"
10/21/19,PG&E says rolling blackouts expected in California for next 10 years! https://cleantechnica.com/2019/10/21/pge-head-says-to-expect-rolling-blackouts-for-the-next-10-years/ …
10/21/19,Order Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power & no blackouts! http://Tesla.com/solar 
10/17/19,Going offline for a few days
10/17/19,Both at the same time!
10/17/19,More about dealing with failure modes & roll control
10/17/19,"Need to deal with thrust asymmetry from flameout of an engine without forcing shutdown of opposing pair engine, which would double thrust loss. Also, thrust differential doesn’t solve roll control well."
10/17/19,"Common myth, but incorrect"
10/16/19,And so begins the robocalypse …

10/16/19,"The final configuration used at Nürburgring to set the record will go into production around summer 2020, so this is not merely for the track"
10/15/19,Anyone who’s interested in working on cutting edge manufacturing — designing & building the machine that makes the machine — please consider working at Tesla or SpaceX. We’re gonna take this to a whole new level!
10/15/19,Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. I’m in awe.
10/15/19,"So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. It’s insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you …"
10/15/19,"Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing I’ve ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit."
10/15/19,"Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard"
10/15/19,And the lead character is also named Woody pic.twitter.com/ZxK84rB020
10/15/19,"Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines"
10/14/19,Conservation of energy tells you the answer
10/14/19,Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
10/14/19,"We def could be wrong about this, but it’s actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place & only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don’t need a lot of room & moment of inertia is much lower."
10/14/19,"Also, we’re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that’s leaving a lot on the table"
10/14/19,"Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec."
10/14/19,"Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W > 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with >260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably <120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now."
10/14/19,Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect …
10/14/19,"This is true. All that matters is number used in ∆v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v "
10/14/19,"Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen & oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters."
10/14/19,"We’re working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that aren’t actual parking spaces."
10/14/19,"Yeah, great team!"
10/14/19,"To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth. pic.twitter.com/21hICWczMq"
10/14/19,"Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere."
10/14/19,"Most people aren’t aware that orbit (and “zero” gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space."
10/14/19,"Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear & drainage is better in vertical config. Also, more representive of flight. Test as you fly …"
10/14/19,Software
10/14/19,Yes
10/14/19,Will start rendering traffic cones in the display soon
10/14/19,Venus would be very difficult
10/14/19,TRUE
10/14/19,"Yes, we will"
10/14/19,"It is actually called deep rain, as sort of a joke at Tesla. Takes a surprising amount of deep learning to know when & how fast to move the wipers."
10/14/19,"Deep Rain™️ neural net coming soon. We’re not trademarking any other Autopilot neural nets, just this one, because rain is deep."
10/14/19,"Yep, good catch"
10/14/19,♥️ hot pot
10/14/19,Cybertruck doesn’t look like anything I’ve seen bouncing around the Internet. It’s closer to an armored personnel carrier from the future.

10/12/19,Nice 🤣🤣
10/12/19,Solar
10/12/19,"Depends on total system efficiency & how long the propellant plant can run to refill Starship, so 1 to 10MW as a rough guess"
10/12/19,"Whoa, that does look good!"
10/12/19,Fair point. Will hold on EU price change until Tesla gets clarity from regulators about Smart Summon feature release date.

10/12/19,".@DrPatSoonShiong, are you aware that one of your senior journalists (Russ Mitchell) is openly funding a fake charity run by an online bully?"
10/12/19,Super messed up situation!
10/12/19,Several finesse improvements coming to Smart Summon in coming weeks. Will be smooth as silk.
10/12/19,Should be much better at this point
10/12/19,Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts
10/12/19,"Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry …"
10/12/19,"Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist."
10/12/19,Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid
10/12/19,"V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout."
10/12/19,"When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you’ll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many & much better than driving a single car."
10/12/19,Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that’s problematic above ~30 deg latitude.
10/12/19,😉
10/12/19,"Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released."
10/12/19,"Still working with RDW, the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why there’s a delay. Other countries are supportive."
10/12/19,"Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov 1"
10/12/19,Get Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power & no more blackouts! http://Tesla.com/solar 
10/12/19,Will be throughout Canada
10/11/19,It’s something special
10/10/19,Fundamental metric of good of Tesla is how many years sooner it brings the advent of a sustainable energy future
10/10/19,True 🤣🤣
10/10/19,I ♥️ Asterix & Obelix!
10/10/19,Exactly
10/10/19,Ok
10/10/19,Also adding Tesla Solar to our Supercharger stations as fast as possible. Goal is 24/7 clean power with no blackouts.
10/10/19,All Tesla Supercharger stations in regions affected by California power outages will have Tesla Powerpacks within next few weeks. Just waiting on permits.

10/8/19,All hardware is at the Cape. Need to do static fire and reconfigure for flight. Launch probably late Nov / early Dec.
10/8/19,"We had to reallocate some resources to speed this up & received great support from Airborne, our parachute supplier. I was at their Irvine factory with the SpaceX team on Sat and Sun. We’re focusing on the advanced Mk3 chute, which provides highest safety factor for astronauts."

10/1/19,I have that exact thought every time I get the flu
10/1/19,Clearly a sign of the apocalypse!
10/1/19,Lot of ways to melt & join steel. Mostly just needs to be welded consistently & with precise parts.
10/1/19,Thankfully not. FSW is very difficult to get right & not needed with steel.
10/1/19,"Production version will be a lot more polished than this prototype, but still fun to see"

9/27/19,There’s so much power going through this engine that it’s close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places
9/27/19,Yes
9/27/19,"Well, hopefully closer to 300 bar over time. However, that the chamber/nozzle jacket has so many joints & dissimilar metals at such high pressure & temperature is what I find remarkable about it."
9/27/19,"No, we’ve been focusing on production (now on SN12). Only need 250 bar or even a bit less for Starship/Super Heavy. Anything above 250 is nice to have & we’ll get around to it, but not needed for flight."
9/27/19,Probably around 6 or 7pm

9/24/19,"Could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling & quite robust"
9/24/19,"Better just to ride your max temp all the way down & let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing."
9/24/19,"Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat."
9/24/19,"It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating"

9/22/19,😉
9/22/19,Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle & ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
9/22/19,"For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass & pressure."
9/22/19,"Current analysis, which I’m not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2"
9/22/19,"Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear & fwd fins during entry & landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward “fin” would simply be used as a leg."
9/22/19,Stability is not an issue with 3
9/22/19,"Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors & rear fins at the bottom."
9/22/19,"Yes. There’s a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the ground, which is why we haven’t closed it out."

9/21/19,Yes
9/21/19,Great work by SpaceX parachute engineering! The Crew Dragon parachutes are way more difficult than they may seem. The Apollo program found them to be so hard that it became a notable morale problem!

9/17/19,Exactly
9/17/19,"Actually, Model 3 would beat the Taycan on Nürburgring over multiple laps, as it has more range"
9/17/19,"No, but very close"
9/17/19,"Rear facing, but roomier. Great for family gatherings! I did a road trip across America with my five boys & Talulah in the 7 seat Model S several years ago."
9/17/19,Absolutely
9/17/19,New Roadster and X will come later
9/17/19,"No, original 5 forward facing seats plus 2 rear-facing smaller seats. The new rear seats will accommodate larger passengers than before."
9/17/19,It’s a start. We expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production 7 seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct/Nov next year.

9/14/19,Wise words from Gary the Bot
9/14/19,"However, we won’t customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla & customer legal bill to be high & drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense."
9/14/19,Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at  http://Tesla.com/bigsolar . https://twitter.com/cleantechnica/status/1172941000463044609 …
9/14/19,"Exactly! We’ve only one car factory in California & one Gigafactory (for batteries & drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries & drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs & improve logistics worldwide."
9/14/19,"Should note that these product mix & logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK & Ireland right now, but we don’t raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win."
9/14/19,"That’s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous & possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I’m looking into it"
9/14/19,"At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes & logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances."
9/14/19,"The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally & should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world."
9/14/19,Agreed
9/14/19,"Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval."
9/14/19,"There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all."
9/14/19,"Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining."
9/14/19,"Hopefully, next year"
9/14/19,"Personally, I think the universe looks great for 12 billion years, let alone 13.8"

9/10/19,Will be answered on 28th
9/10/19,Exactly
9/10/19,Looks good
9/10/19,The mechanical attachment mechanism. We need to make sure they won’t fall off due to vibration & acoustics.
9/10/19,48 61 20 68 61
9/10/19,"The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal."
9/9/19,"Failure rate is actually both higher & lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate."
9/9/19,Precisely
9/9/19,"Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven’t moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you’ll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox & fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you’re prob ok."
9/9/19,🤣🤣
9/9/19,You know destination weather before departure & there’s no weather in space
9/9/19,"Everything happens so fast. It’s such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins."
9/9/19,"Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell & fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull."
9/9/19,"Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but that’s not indicative of capability."
9/9/19,"Over time, 355 & 385 are possible, but very difficult"
9/9/19,Most likely
9/9/19,Photoshop is amazing
9/9/19,"Sea level Raptor’s vacuum Isp is ~350 sec, but ~380 sec with larger vacuum-optimized nozzle"

9/5/19,It’s up to 🇳🇴 & 🇳🇱 as to whether they go with EU rules or rest of world. Not our choice.
9/4/19,"Same, except where limited by EU regulations. We’re aware of extreme consumer unhappiness about this & are working with EU regulators to address."

8/24/19,Exactly! Especially let your PUC commissioners/authorities know.
8/24/19,"Agreed, that’s the right future"
8/24/19,Looks like @SpaceX Starhopper flight may be as soon as Monday. FAA support is much appreciated!

8/20/19,Everyone who bought FSD will receive priority/early access
8/20/19,"Price increase for Tesla FSD postponed until version 10 with smart summon is in wide release, which is about 4 to 8 weeks away, depending on how early access goes"
8/20/19,"Not risky imo & can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system’s fusion reactor (the sun)."
8/20/19,"True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids & a mass driver, but this is risky."
8/20/19,"Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive."
8/20/19,"Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins & landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September"
8/20/19,Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
8/20/19,"Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth & gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming"

8/20/19,Might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites 🛰 to warm Mars vs artificial suns (tbd)
8/20/19,"AF certification required an enormous amount of work. It’s mostly design-review based, not flight-based."

8/9/19,"Will be needed for sure. Bandwidth, no problem, latency is a challenge 🤣🤣"
8/9/19,"Just spoke with FAA, so hopefully yes"
8/9/19,"Thanks. Starship, which aspires to be fully & immediately reusable in super heavy class, is a truly 🥜🚀. Even though I’m immersed in Starship/Raptor design & build 7 days/week, it still doesn’t feel real."
8/9/19,"Approx min payload to Mars to nearest order of magnitude, so at $100k/ton, cost would be $100B"
8/9/19,"Powerwall doesn’t need solar panels, but will work fine with both Tesla & non-Tesla solar panels"
8/9/19,Yes
8/9/19,Between $100B and $10T
8/9/19,Amazing work over many years by SpaceX engineering/production/launch teams to get (almost) there
8/9/19,For sure
8/9/19,Yup
8/9/19,Might take a bit longer to get through regulatory approvals. Likely September.

8/9/19,No sooner than a week. Working approvals with FAA.
8/9/19,"Wouldn’t read too much into this. Likely to be fewer F9/FH flights, but possibly an order of magnitude more than these numbers in Starship flights."

8/8/19,"Ultimately, however, what really matters is empirical safety. Nothing in life is 100% safe, so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident."
8/8/19,"Good question. NHTSA is great for fundamental structural safety, except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor. Very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted. NCAP also great, but there are some weird headlight angle factors. Super inside baseball stuff …"

8/6/19,No
8/6/19,"Vandenberg is great for polar orbits. Will still play an important role long-term, but 80%+ will be eastward."

7/28/19,Tesla Service Centers & a lot more Superchargers coming to Poland later this year
7/28/19,Will recognize & read all signs for FSD. Focused on traffic lights & stop signs right now. Most are very easy. Difficulty is millions of corner cases.
7/28/19,"Hoping to get “Joe Mode” into V10. The default, of course, is normal volume, but selecting “Joe Mode” would lower the volume of strident beeps & chimes by half."

7/28/19,Yes
7/28/19,Some
7/28/19,"Not currently in V10, but will try"

7/16/19,"“If you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more.” — Gen Shinseki"
7/16/19,"As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit."
7/16/19,Probably
7/16/19,Agreed. That’s approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
7/16/19,Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16
7/16/19,"Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can’t make enough of them & we won’t be able to."
7/16/19,"No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers"
7/16/19,"If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week"

7/12/19,"More like 30 to 40 mT to GTO ~27 deg. Plane change is 2*v*sin θ/2, as I recall, but doesn’t matter, as there’s no geo 🛰 anywhere near that mass."
7/12/19,3
7/12/19,"100mT to 125mT for true useful load to useful orbit (eg Starlink mission), including propellant reserves. 150mT for reference payload compared to other rockets. This is in fully reusable config. About double in fully expendable config, which is hopefully never."
7/12/19,Cont of main
7/12/19,We changed the design quite a bit. More about this in late July.
7/12/19,~20m up & sideways for first flight. Mk1 Starship hopefully 20km up in a few months.

7/11/19,"It’s Not a Flamethrower, Mr Escobar https://apple.news/AnZnseCGjTFGzyhZO3dqAKw …"
7/11/19,Sure
7/11/19,Exactly
7/10/19,The @Space_Station is moving at ~25 times the speed of sound & orbits the Earth every 90 minutes https://twitter.com/wonderofscience/status/1147877818191106053 …
7/10/19,Ok
7/10/19,"Absolutely agree, you should be allowed to move your Tesla anywhere in the world, unless it’s prevented by government rules. Thanks for letting me know."
7/9/19,Feeling extra 🍀 button
7/9/19,Done. I’m feeling 🍀 & I’m feeling 😋 navigation buttons coming with next software release.
7/9/19,Whoop Whoop!!
7/9/19,I think so. Will check.

7/9/19,Would be cool if car took you to a random fun place traveled to by other Tesla owners in the area
7/9/19,Sigh
7/9/19,The answer is always aliens pic.twitter.com/lql9XTJ7kb
7/9/19,Nice
7/9/19,I have over the years
7/9/19,That was a real sign
7/9/19,"I actually asked Ashlee Vance not to write the book several times. Inevitably, some things are wrong and then those errors are repeated for years."
7/9/19,TRUE
7/9/19,Exactly
7/9/19,No
7/9/19,No
7/9/19,"There is no “refreshed” Model X or Model S coming, only a series of minor ongoing changes. Most significant change in past few years was to use high efficiency Model 3 rear drive unit as S/X front drive unit. That went into production 3 months ago."
7/8/19,This shampoo sounds amazing
7/8/19,No problem
7/8/19,The Cape is one of the two Starship build sites. More on this later.

7/8/19,May the light of consciousness shine bright
7/8/19,"Overall successful. Aborted at T+51 sec on high mixture ratio, but we were intentionally probing the corners of the box of operating conditions, so not surprising."
7/8/19,Exactly
7/8/19,Sure 🤖 🚘 😀
7/8/19,"To be clear, consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla, but the clearing price will rise significantly, as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car"
7/8/19,"Between first development engine & first flight engine with operational payload, there are always hundreds of changes to both hardware & software. Over time, thousands."
7/8/19,Upgrading to 250kW soon
7/8/19,"Intersections with complex traffic lights & shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios, but massive effort required to get to 99.9999% safety."
7/8/19,Local supporters will be invited!
7/8/19,Yes
7/8/19,~Q4 2016
7/8/19,"End of Q4, most likely"
7/8/19,"Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality won’t diverge until Q4, as it’s limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies."
7/8/19,This is why it’s possible for Tesla to have a million robotaxis by end of 2020 if we upgrade existing HW2 fleet of ~500k & make at least ~500k FSD cars
7/8/19,All HW2+ cars are upgradable to full self-driving capability with Tesla FSD computer & all production in past few months has FSD computer

6/30/19,"FWIW, based on calcs I did 10 years ago, cross-over point for Li-ion beating kerosene is ~400 Wh/kg. High cycle batteries are just over 300 Wh/kg today, but probably exceed 400 in ~5 years."
6/30/19,"Jet A (kerosene) has much higher energy density than Li-ion, but electric motors weigh much less & convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines"
6/29/19,"Yes, but still a bit too limited on range. That will change in coming years as battery energy density improves."

6/27/19,"Hardly anyone noticed, but still"
6/27/19,We worked so hard to create that exact view. Seat rails flush with floor on a rear-slanted monopost.
6/27/19,Design & production of The Spirit of St Louis was so incredible  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_of_St._Louis …
6/27/19,2.1 sec 0-60 mph is base model before adding rocket thruster option
6/27/19,That’s actually kinda true
6/26/19,Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower & Starship doesn’t have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
6/26/19,You’re touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We’re fixing that with Starship.
6/26/19,"That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney’s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you’d exit on another continent."
6/26/19,"~1000, as all seats would be “coach” & no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It’s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands."
6/26/19,"About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips."
6/26/19,"That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher & stability of booster in ground winds is low"
6/26/19,There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.
6/26/19,"Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible."
6/26/19,"Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work."
6/26/19,Probably sooner
6/26/19,Ok
6/26/19,"Sure, that would be an honor"
6/26/19,Most likely. It is programmed to do so.
6/26/19,High entry force & heat breached engine bay & center engine TVC failed

6/26/19,Working on Tesla global logistics
6/26/19,I know … sigh. Those are truly a work of art.
6/26/19,"Yes, but we couldn’t take a chance on 2nd stage failing it’s 4th maneuver. This mission was more complex than anything I’m aware of in history of rockets. RIP center core, you did your duty well."
6/25/19,Ms. Tree caught the Falcon fairing!!
6/25/19,High payload/delta-V missions will always be far downrange. Value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. Altitude is almost unimportant.
6/25/19,Center core RUD. It was a long shot.
6/25/19,He was the real deal

6/24/19,🖤 Tesla Software Engineering 🖤
6/24/19,Falcon Heavy on LC-39A pic.twitter.com/FsfFa7bRRK
6/24/19,"All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox & fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness & needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms 🤗"
6/24/19,It’s a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
6/24/19,"Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock & strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor."
6/24/19,"Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more"
6/24/19,Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals & bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.
6/24/19,So cool
6/24/19,Anything with high contrast
6/24/19,Excessive shades of grey
6/24/19,"Yeah, we’ve been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous."
6/24/19,"Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy & immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps."
6/24/19,Third revision of Enhanced Summon hopefully going to Tesla owners with early access later this week
6/24/19,Haha
6/24/19,Depends on destination
6/24/19,"Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level"
6/24/19,"Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1."
6/24/19,Chomsky sucks
6/24/19,"Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=R7qT-C-0ajI …"
6/24/19,Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
6/24/19,"More than that now, but <10% of that in volume, although much to be proven"
6/24/19,"Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year."
6/24/19,"Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design & replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year."

5/31/19,"Also HEPA filter is expensive, so would force increase in price"
5/31/19,Same
5/31/19,Not enough room unless we completely delete front trunk. Model S & X primary HEPA filter alone is literally 1000% bigger than normal car air filter.
5/31/19,S/X HEPA filter is one of my favorite features

5/31/19,Feedback received. Restoring white interior.
5/31/19,That’s the idea
5/30/19,🤣
5/30/19,Thoughtful model
5/30/19,"Based on our data, Autopilot miles appear to be twice as safe as manually driven miles, and we expect this to improve further"
5/30/19,Tesla is affecting powerful vested interests. Big auto & oil companies aren’t known for their gentle behavior. SpaceX is battling US military prime contractors & space programs of national govts. No walk in the park there.
5/30/19,"Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity & ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach 20."
5/30/19,"Add 2 to 4 more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth. You can go surprisingly far, even with low lift/drag. This was an unexpected result."
5/30/19,Wings/flaps & leg design changing again (sigh). Doesn’t affect schedule much though.
5/30/19,Not bad
5/30/19,Exactly. We’re on the wrong planet for SSTO. No problem on Mars or any of the moons.
5/29/19,"Yeah, the fear, uncertainty & doubt propaganda campaign being pushed by those betting against Tesla has reached new heights"
5/29/19,I paid most of my Tesla-related expenses too. Tesla last year was actually net negative comp for me.
5/29/19,"One day’s grace, taking into account time zone confusion. Will revert tomorrow."
5/29/19,Edgy move
5/28/19,Good idea
5/28/19,True. I’m a gamer & my boys are too. Starlink is designed to be great even for competitive twitch reflex games.
5/28/19,Yup
5/27/19,Would love to do exactly that
5/27/19,"Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We’ll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits & arrays are tracking to sun."
5/27/19,"Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we’ll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science."
5/27/19,Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.
5/27/19,"Yes, already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy."
5/27/19,"Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers"
5/27/19,"If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that’s easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris … pic.twitter.com/NllMXregRg"
5/27/19,"There are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won’t be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully & will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible. pic.twitter.com/OuWYfNmw0D"
5/27/19,"No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency."
5/26/19,Fair
5/25/19,Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy & internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.
5/25/19,Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites & allow some amount of yaw steering.
5/25/19,"Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars."
5/25/19,"Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density & thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp & up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum."

5/24/19,No
5/24/19,🤣🤣 Absolutely
5/24/19,"Yes, 3 to 6 months"
5/24/19,Lights would turn off automatically when no motion is detected
5/24/19,Thus *reducing* existing road traffic
5/24/19,Another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps & elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot
5/24/19,"Opposite is true: you can have 100’s of layers of tunnels, but only one layer on surface (to first approximation), therefore trains should be on surface, cars below"
5/24/19,"Yes, but you get to your destination so quickly & directly that it doesn’t matter"
5/24/19,"Exactly. Still, pretty wild that the engine plume can climb up the side of a rocket going hypersonic speed!"
5/24/19,Paperwork & hundreds of approving authorities is by far the hardest part
5/24/19,"LA has a subway, but most people don’t know about it"
5/24/19,That would great!
5/24/19,Yes. No one will forced to take the tunnel. It’s optional!

5/24/19,Gary the 🐌 still crushes us! Wouldn’t be fair. But TBC might give him a run for his money next year.
5/24/19,Fundamental advantage of layers of tunnels is you can have as many lanes as you want going in any direction. Will feel like folding space from one part of a city to another.

5/23/19,"Yes, will be used for rear cargo storage. Also helps manage center of mass for heavy payloads when forward cargo is full."
5/23/19,Outer engines are attached to the edge of the airframe to give the center engines room to move
5/23/19,~2.8m
5/23/19,"Turbines on hot side (outer fan-looking things in this depiction), but this is just to illustrate the type of engine. Our turbopumps are vertical, have 3 fan-looking things on pump side & complex cross-flow. Liquid oxygen turbopump is integrated with main combustion chamber."

5/23/19,3 months
5/23/19,"Hopefully, 4 months"
5/23/19,Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions. Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly & at high angle for landing. Larger nozzle leaves less room to move & increases moment of inertia.
5/23/19,"Yeah. Outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to airframe, inner engines have high gimbal range ~15 degrees"

5/23/19,Two tunnels about a mile long each
5/23/19,Yes
5/23/19,"Makes no sense. In order to grow the colony, you’d have to transport vast amounts of mass from planets/moons/asteroids. Would be like trying to build the USA in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!"
5/23/19,"Aiming for 150 tons useful load in fully reusable configuration, but should be at least 100 tons, allowing for mass growth"
5/23/19,N2 for vacuum. Aero surfaces & high gimbal angle main engines for atmosphere.
5/23/19,"Hoping for 380 sec Isp, but at least 370. Otherwise similar to sea level version."

5/22/19,"But, essentially, the spinning things"
5/22/19,Yes
5/22/19,"Turbopump propellant flow path to achieve high chamber pressure is quite tricky. Requires an inducer & 2 impellers with ~100,000 shaft horsepower."

4/29/19,Genau
4/29/19,Might be boring
4/29/19,Physics is a set of compression functions for the simulation
4/29/19,It’s pretty much the only theory. This will mess with your mind:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude …
4/29/19,Sensors are for the weak. Just go open loop.
4/29/19,So true

4/28/19,"NVIDIA is a great company, but we needed (essentially) a dedicated ASIC for vision-based driving, whereas their solution needs to serve many different customer needs."
4/28/19,I think it will be something like that. Much more productive to manage a fleet of robotaxis than only drive one taxi yourself.
4/28/19,"21 TOPS for Xavier. Pegasus is just Xavier with a power hog GPU on a separate board. Problem is you can’t transfer data fast enough between computer & GPU, so GPU usable TOPS is almost irrelevant."
4/28/19,"Exactly, Tesla & Nvidia numbers described by Pete were max *usable* teraops running our vision net"
4/27/19,We’re working on it. Takes time to get all regulatory approvals. Almost there for the larger US states. At least 6 to 12 months for Europe/UK.

4/24/19,Tesla blows haha
4/23/19,We can probably just repurpose Model 3 HVAC parts. Not a big deal.
4/23/19,TRUE
4/23/19,Long lasting battery + fast recharge > pack swap
4/23/19,Haha ok
4/23/19,"It’s been suggested by many, externally & internally"
4/23/19,Aren’t there good ones already?

4/23/19,"Yeah, there was a major change in last several months. Everyone noticed, Fred. Hello."
4/23/19,Will do
4/23/19,Absolutely
4/23/19,Seriously
4/23/19,"Also, how did you manage to get shamed into being de facto anti-Tesla by social media trolls. Jeez …"
4/23/19,"Fred, every fire *is* investigated. Problem is those who only write about 0 injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article, misleading readers into thinking EV’s have high fire risk when opposite is true."
4/23/19,"Thanks, support super appreciated"
4/23/19,Sad if true 😔
4/23/19,"When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe there’s a good reason that isn’t obvious."
4/23/19,"Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?"
4/23/19,"Over a million combustion engine (it’s right there in the name!) car fires per year & thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question."
4/23/19,"Those who predicted Tesla & EVs would be dead & autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?"
4/23/19,Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars & autonomy was between 10 years & never … https://twitter.com/Everman/status/1120466365834514432 …
4/23/19,Anti-matter def wins on energy density 🤣🤣
4/23/19,"Exactly. By end of this quarter, about half a million Teslas will have full self-driving hardware (pending computer swap) & we will make another half million FSD cars by mid next year."
4/23/19,"As a robotaxi, probably closer to 16 hours, accounting for empty legs, travel to charger/cleaning/service, wait times, etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost, battery wear cost & larger range pack needed."

4/23/19,Reddit is hardcore. Mostly correct analysis. Comments so dark …
4/23/19,Or maybe pegging
4/23/19,"On yeah, that too"
4/23/19,"Exactly. Also, you can’t actually use computation from a separate GPU effectively, as you get choked on the bus, so most of the computation is irrelevant. High power, high cooling, but low true, usable TOPS. Worst of all worlds."

4/14/19,Good interview by @lexfridman
4/14/19,Truth
4/14/19,Exactly
4/14/19,How embarrassing. Will change.
4/14/19,We will. You read it right.
4/14/19,Haha true
4/14/19,I’ve always thought that the fundamental good of Tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport & energy
4/14/19,"Good point, small oil is a problem too"
4/14/19,"I’m sorry, Fred, but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They can’t *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ exposé pieces on oil, coal & gas? That industry is 1000 times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps they’re all angels …"
4/14/19,"Yes, this was an utter boldface (literally) lie! Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false."
4/14/19,"True, Bloomberg is almost as bad"
4/14/19,Holman Jenkins & WSJ in general are sock 🧦 puppets of big oil
4/14/19,Starship is kinda Gundam
4/14/19,"Very much so. There are 2.5B cars & trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that’s a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -> demand >> supply."
4/14/19,"Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesn’t have access to the video unless sent to us by owner."

4/14/19,"Wow, a lot of people don’t know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First 6-12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve."
4/14/19,"There is 35 GWh/yr “theoretical capacity”, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3’s in Q1 due to cell constraints."
4/13/19,Yes
4/13/19,"Yes, all cars with Autopilot 2.0 or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date"
4/13/19,"Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesn’t cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability"
4/13/19,Yes
4/13/19,"There will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase"
4/13/19,"Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later."
4/13/19,Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
4/13/19,Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr & have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won’t spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.
4/13/19,Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months
4/13/19,Something like that
4/13/19,Starting May 1
4/13/19,Please note that the price of the Tesla Full Self-Driving option will increase substantially over time

4/13/19,Model 3 drive unit & body is designed like a commercial truck for a million mile life. Current battery modules should last 300k to 500k miles (1500 cycles). Replacing modules (not pack) will only cost $5k to $7k.

4/5/19,"Yes, instead of someone needing to drive their car personally, they can manage a fleet of self-driving cars"
4/5/19,That’s exactly the idea. What’s not well understood is that Tesla cars being made *today* will be able to do that for you. Just a matter of finishing the software & going through regulatory approval. Will be explained in depth via live webcast on April 22.
4/5/19,Thanks 😀

4/5/19,I’m told it’s looking positive & we will be allowed to continue servicing our cars in Texas
4/5/19,Sentry Mode is barely at V1.0. Will improve a lot in coming months.
4/5/19,Impressive analysis
4/5/19,"Only external cameras are being used right now, so internal is not enabled. When it is enabled, we’ll add a setting to disable internal camera."
4/5/19,"Also, it can be used to supplement cameras on outside of vehicle, as it can see through 2nd side windows & rear window."
4/5/19,"It’s there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft & people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video."

4/3/19,Night mode default brightness is actually too high imo. Should be lower & allow below current “0%” level. Making that adjustment too.
4/3/19,Agreed
4/3/19,Night mode with 0% brightness is actually too dark during the day. This is ultimately our fault. We will update our software so that 0% brightness is always usable relative to ambient conditions.
4/3/19,Change your screen preference from night mode to auto

3/30/19,Instagram comments are coding in emojis
3/30/19,Also true
3/30/19,TRUE
3/30/19,The quality of emojis varies wildly
3/30/19,Lame
3/30/19,🦆
3/30/19,C++ syntax sucks
3/30/19,"Assert (“Money” == Series of heterogeneous databases insecurely connected with high latency. Primary purpose == Information system for allocation of human time. As automation++, value of money--);"
3/30/19,Even connectivity at my house in Silicon Valley sucks!
3/30/19,Like the movie Us. Scary … but also empathetic.
3/30/19,"No, but for sure the other way around!"
3/30/19,"Also the intense low frequency vibrations that you can’t hear, but you can feel in your chest"
3/30/19,"We’re going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot & fast, so dicey."
3/30/19,"Annoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can’t. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that’s very rare."
3/30/19,"Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last year’s vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer & max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying."
3/30/19,"Probably no fairing either & just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see what’s there. Not impossible."
3/30/19,"Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it’s slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2."
3/30/19,Anyone who bought FSD will get it
3/29/19,"Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 & HW3. Going forward “HW3” will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important. https://twitter.com/samscho/status/1110649850188558336 …"
3/29/19,Yes. Sensitive propulsion & avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon 1.
3/29/19,"Massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. Best choice for the impatient. Ion engines are too slow."
3/29/19,"We should send probes to outer solar system & get high res, true color images of these strange things. Maybe there’s an alien artifact out there …"
3/29/19,Super cool!
3/29/19,Good point
3/29/19,"Tax authorities tend to interpret things in their favor, but it sure sounds like you could be right! Will investigate."
3/28/19,"Rare use case, but it is possible. There are complications with this. Eary prototype Roadsters had this ability."
3/28/19,Exactly
3/27/19,Super proud of Tesla Autopilot team!
3/27/19,"No, it is one week either way."
3/27/19,🤗
3/26/19,"I think so. For sure worth giving it our best shot! Would be great to have a competitive, commercial program to build a moon base that is outcome-oriented (not cost-plus), so you only get paid for safe delivery of cargo."

3/26/19,"Yes, otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high and/or center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained.

Yes, but we’re going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads."

3/17/19,White-hot parts reached orbital entry temp of around 1650 Kelvin
3/17/19,"Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium & carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach 8 or 9, moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint."
3/17/19,Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing.  Zero refurbishment.

3/17/19,We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Don’t need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.
3/17/19,"You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump & combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber."
3/17/19,"Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship & Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations."
3/17/19,Agreed
3/17/19,"Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We’re simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed."
3/17/19,"Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout …"
3/17/19,"Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine & stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely."

3/16/19,Yes!
3/16/19,"Definitely down the road, once construction & upgrades aren’t so crazy"
3/16/19,"This causes some media confusion, as batch builds & ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month & terrible following month, but consumer tastes don’t actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules."
3/16/19,"Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations & we try to build in batches to simplify production"
3/16/19,"Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer"
3/16/19,"Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that’s a lot of complexity."
3/16/19,"Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn’t critical for snowy regions."
3/16/19,"Still get this question a lot, even though Norway 🇳🇴 has highest Tesla cars per person on 🌏 (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice."

3/12/19,"In retrospect, lower price shouldn’t have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldn’t afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday."
3/12/19,"However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak"
3/12/19,"We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference — about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team & board."
3/12/19,"When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought don’t want to write Tesla a check. So it goes."

3/3/19,"Thank you on behalf of SpaceX. Also, thank you to @NASA, without whom this would not be possible."
3/2/19,Power will increase on all cars. Top speed on 3P increases to 162mph. Range on RWD 3 increases to 325 miles.
3/2/19,"Yes, new cars and existing fleet"
3/2/19,Firmware update coming later this month will increase power by ~5% & top speed by 10 km/h or 7mph
3/2/19,Spoiler alert: not Porsche
3/2/19,Thank you on behalf of the many people of SpaceX

3/2/19,Need to get back to SpaceX launch control. Sorry this solution isn’t perfect.
3/2/19,"We’re trying to make EVs & autonomy more affordable over time. This is the right thing to do. However, we cannot then also retroactively make earlier buyers whole without killing the company."
3/2/19,Will take a few days for system update
3/2/19,"Yeah, we need a few days to update the system. If anyone already paid $3k, they should get $1k back."
3/2/19,"It’s not exactly symmetric, but it will come with HW3 upgrade long-term"
3/2/19,"If you bought enhanced autopilot, FSD upgrade costs $2k instead of $5k"
3/2/19,"If you bought a Tesla before yesterday’s price reduction, you can have Autopilot or full self-driving at half normal cost (up to $6k less) https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/1101721765707825152 …"

3/1/19,"Base Model 3 available in Europe in ~6 months, Asia 6 to 8 months. Latter contingent on Shanghai Gigafactory. Country-specific taxes & import duties mean price may be 25% or more above US number."
3/1/19,Exactly
3/1/19,No reductions from here
3/1/19,For sure. It fundamentally improves quality of life.
3/1/19,Best choice for most people is standard range plus with Autopilot
3/1/19,Exact Tesla Model 3 in my profile pic costs $35k before incentives & takes 1 minute to buy online at http://Tesla.com 
2/28/19,I think we should do something here. Will talk with team & send out a note in next few days.
2/28/19,Should be ~5% peak power increase with March 15 software release
2/28/19,"Scheduled for March 15 release, along with many other improvements"
2/28/19,"Everyone who bought Enhanced Autopilot will get Navigate on Autopilot on highways, advanced summon & autopark"

2/26/19,"Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active, so only ~50 full-time equivalent people right now. That will grow a lot as we enter production. It’s 10X harder (at least) to design engine production system than engine. In automotive, 100X harder."
2/26/19,"Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed, tight follow distance in test tunnel."
2/26/19,"Yes, exciting potential"
2/26/19,Exactly
2/26/19,"Printers are too small. Also, high pressure, high efficiency engines need copper cooling channels with an inco/steel jacket. Can’t print yet."
2/26/19,Exactly. This has now happened several times. Something is broken with SEC oversight.
2/26/19,"Tom did an awesome job leading Merlin, Kestrel, Draco & other engine developments from start through 2014 that were critical to SpaceX’s success. Great respect & appreciation!"
2/26/19,"Thank you Evelyn, I loved it"
2/26/19,"Indeed. I have great respect for judges. It’s not perfect, but, in general, we should be very glad of the US justice system."
2/26/19,"SEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k. How embarrassing … 🤗"

2/22/19,Great meme review hosted by Will Smith https://twitter.com/grandayy/status/1099037391669653509 …
2/22/19,Haha true
2/22/19,It’s designed to be way better. We’ll see what reality has to say about that.
2/22/19,"Yes, lot of risk"
2/22/19,"Guys, I have feelings … 😜"
2/22/19,Focusing on Starship instead
2/22/19,Deorbits & burns up over the Pacific
2/22/19,"Upper stage is flight, except mass sim in place of Merlin. It will get fragged for sure by aero loads & Dragon abort thrusters."
2/22/19,"Including Heavy, which is 3 cores, around 20 or so"
2/22/19,"Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. That’s scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big."
2/22/19,"High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise, at least 20 or 30 missions for Falcon 9. Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life."
2/22/19,Crew Dragon high altitude abort test
2/22/19,Yes 😀
2/22/19,Highest reentry heating to date. Burning metal sparks from base heat shield visible in landing video. Fourth relight scheduled for April. https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1098762992848535553 …
2/21/19,Always liked Kestrel. It was the Robin Hood of engines.
2/21/19,"Advanced, reusable rockets are all we need to become a multiplanet civilization. Once we have a city on Mars, interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in spaceflight."
2/21/19,SN2 has changes that should help
2/21/19,To the first part. I doubt we’d create a Dyson ring or sphere.
2/21/19,Yes
2/21/19,"Merlins. The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN 1 (as expected). A lot of the parts are fine for reuse, but next tests will be with SN 2, which is almost done."
2/21/19,"Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun."
2/21/19,"Exactly. Super money move is anti-matter drive, especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space."
2/21/19,You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos
2/21/19,Pinter injector tends to have hot & cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
2/21/19,"Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars."
2/21/19,"We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done"
2/21/19,"Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing ☺️High engine chamber pressure and ablative don’t get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage."
2/21/19,"That’s true 😀 Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there."
2/21/19,"Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for “launch capability”. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that."
2/21/19,Don’t know
2/21/19,"SpaceX commercial 🚀 launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years. pic.twitter.com/sqAYCCcJtd"
2/21/19,"Exactly. That’s the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species."
2/21/19,"SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight & thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I’m worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics."
2/21/19,So true 🤡 John Clarke 👌
2/21/19,"Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure & temperature in oxygen preburner"
2/21/19,Whoever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel prize in delayed gratification
2/21/19,"That said, I still only own 0.25 BTC, which a friend sent me several years ago. Don’t have any crypto holdings."

2/20/19,"Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k."
2/20/19,Won’t be long before they do

2/18/19,Did meme review last night with Justin Roiland from @RickandMorty
2/18/19,Agreed. Also needs option for automatically on all locations or if unknown location.
2/17/19,Pics are so clear in space!
2/17/19,That last bit gives a good sense of what orbit is like
2/17/19,"Also, Tesla was competing for some of same people as OpenAI & I didn’t agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do. Add that all up & it was just better to part ways on good terms."
2/17/19,I had to focus on solving a painfully large number of engineering & manufacturing problems at Tesla (especially) & SpaceX
2/17/19,"To clarify, I’ve not been involved closely with OpenAI for over a year & don’t have mgmt or board oversight"

2/14/19,"Probably a month or two. Sentry mode became top priority, so pushed that out a bit."

Now I am back"
2/11/19,TRUE
2/11/19,"Moon first, Mars as soon as the planets align"
2/11/19,On my bedside table
2/11/19,A biography on Korolev has center place in my study
2/11/19,"Just planning on keeping the public informed about progress & setbacks. Will be some RUDs along the way, but excitement is guaranteed!"
2/11/19,The goodwill of the public is critical to Starship’s success
2/11/19,At least 10X cheaper
2/11/19,"Very dependent on volume, but I’m confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k & maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth & move to Mars if they want."
2/11/19,Yes
2/11/19,"This will sound implausible, but I think there’s a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9"
2/11/19,Close
2/11/19,"But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter."
2/11/19,Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
2/11/19,"Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 & O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy."
2/11/19,"Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky."
2/11/19,I think 6 where we lit main chamber & several with only preburners
2/11/19,About 11 secs
2/11/19,Definitely! It’s amazing that the RD-170 & RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering.

2/8/19,"Booster center of mass is much lower & more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry"
2/8/19,"Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!"
2/8/19,"Rocket booster temperatures won’t go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body & maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind."
2/7/19,Prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads
2/7/19,"Welded, internal, longitudinal hat stringers. To the degree it may need hoop stiffness (prob not), combine with slosh baffles."
2/7/19,"The Super Heavy booster is only needed on Earth, so think of this as just “Starship” & sometimes it needs a boost, hence Super Heavy"

2/1/19,"Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs 301 stainless full hard at cryo, but latter costs way less, is tougher & doesn’t even need paint!"
2/1/19,Still up to 31. Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
2/1/19,Mostly true
2/1/19,"Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps & main engines for landing orientation, so won’t need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably."
2/1/19,Yes
2/1/19,Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship & booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) & sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).

2/1/19,Yes. It’s very rare to find all three.
2/1/19,"To be clear, I’m confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature & reduced need for heat shielding"
2/1/19,"Will probably make booster legs/flaps same as ship, instead of like F9"
2/1/19,"Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime & angle of attack"

1/23/19,"~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel."
1/23/19,I just heard. 50 mph winds broke the mooring blocks late last night & fairing was blown over. Will take a few weeks to repair.
1/23/19,"310S stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 Kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate 300 degrees of delta temp"

12/22/18,"Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel & we’re using a different alloy mix. I super ♥️ 300 Series Stainless!"
12/22/18,"While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design"

12/19/18,"This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go"
12/19/18,"The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination & then drives on normal roads back to start"
12/19/18,"Actually way more capacity, way faster & way more convenient. Subways are fine, but it’s time to upgrade to something better."
12/19/18,All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians & cyclists
12/19/18,"Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city."
12/19/18,Yes
12/19/18,"This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla"
12/19/18,Tesla in @boringcompany tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train & back again pic.twitter.com/3a6i0NoSmi
12/18/18,Boring product launch will be streamed live at 8pm California time tonight http://boringcompany.com 
12/18/18,Boring is developing an entirely new system of transport
12/18/18,Same applies to those who didn’t order PUP
12/18/18,Exactly. It’s a good way to go. Get people with more money to pay for the development!
12/18/18,"Yeah, I wrote that back in 2006, almost 13 years ago!"
12/18/18,"Clayton is wrong. New tech is always expensive. Tech disruption occurs at *high end*, eg computers & cell phones. It takes many design iterations & vast economies of scale to achieve mass market affordability. pic.twitter.com/Z81VfL0yaz"
12/18/18,Honored to work with amazing teams at SpaceX & Tesla! https://twitter.com/Teslarati/status/1075002416830054402 …
12/18/18,Totally false. Buried in this incredibly misleading WSJ article is the actual statement from Thiel’s Founder’s Fund: “we have no concerns whatsoever.”
12/17/18,"Same facts, same period of time, but extremely different reporting"
12/16/18,‘Tis
12/16/18,Medieval Futurism https://twitter.com/w00ki33/status/1074028244813279232 …
12/16/18,Tesla 💨 app almost done. Important to get every note right!
12/16/18,Thanks!
12/15/18,The white seats are actually extremely stain resistant. You can spill red wine on the seats & just wipe it off.
12/15/18,Congratulations!
12/15/18,"In other words, you may be able to get a Tesla before the $7500 US tax credit drops in 2 weeks, even if you haven’t placed an order yet"
12/15/18,You got it
12/15/18,Pretty good. I have confirmation turned off on my engineering build & interventions are rare. Probably ready to enable no confirmation setting next month.
12/15/18,pic.twitter.com/E8fhyjN0pD
12/14/18,👍
12/14/18,Zero Suit 😉
12/14/18,God Fire
12/14/18,💕🍜 ramen is sooo good🍜 💕
12/14/18,Exactly 😀
12/13/18,This part is true. I was trying to explain that we don’t want our cars to have a “tinny” sound. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwXJsWHupg …
12/12/18,You should def have a loaner. Will take care of it.
12/11/18,Seems likely that we’ll be able to reuse fairings that soft-landed in the ocean. May not need net at all. Would still love to see the catch happen though ⚾️ 👍
12/11/18,"Incorrect. “Chairman” is an honorific, not executive role, which means it’s not needed to run Tesla. Will retire that title at Tesla in 3 years. 60 Mins edited out end of my sentence, where I said I could do whatever I want. They cut “provided I have the support of shareholders”."
12/11/18,About 10 to 14 days
12/11/18,"Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)"
12/11/18,"Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks. 

To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at  http://Tesla.com  or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla can’t deliver your car this year."
12/11/18,No need to wait. It’s super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.
12/11/18,I’m dying to make a pickup truck so bad … we might have a prototype to unveil next year
12/11/18,Yes
12/11/18,"Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they don’t believe in climate change. 

Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they don’t need to be. https://twitter.com/InsideEVs/status/1072485984628105219 …"
12/11/18,Probably next month
12/11/18,You’re right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with @MKBHD tell a more interesting story.
12/11/18,"We’re opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including Knoxville. Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week."
12/11/18,Probably end of next year
12/11/18,So true 🦙💩✨😴
12/11/18,This is a very misleading edit. Please post the full transcript where I complete the sentence.
12/11/18,"60 Mins actually had several hours of interview time, which they distilled to 14 mins. Many stories could been told with that time. This was accurate as viewed from an Upper East Side Manhattan dinner party."
12/9/18,We are awaiting EU regulatory approval for this release
12/9/18,"Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over 10X the image processing ability."
12/9/18,"Already testing traffic lights, stop signs & roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all."
12/9/18,"If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars & takes highway interchanges & off-ramps."
12/9/18,Machete!!
12/9/18,"It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car."
12/9/18,"Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn’t exist or would have started much later. pic.twitter.com/NxCgYO9JXx"
12/9/18,"Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe & later China."
12/9/18,"Buying  http://Tesla.com  took over a decade, $11M & amazing amount of effort. Didn’t like  http://teslamotors.com  even when we were only making 🚘."
12/9/18,"Tesla history trivia: we didn’t actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He’d originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later. https://twitter.com/60Minutes/status/1071174335778447361 …"
12/9/18,"Both, but demo Starship is being built now, whereas Super Heavy hardware will start getting built in spring"
12/9/18,But cool pics of the demo Starship that will fly suborbital hops coming in ~4 weeks
12/9/18,Yes
12/9/18,Interesting
12/9/18,"Fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong"
12/9/18,The new design is metal
12/8/18,"As far as we know, it’s the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint."
12/7/18,Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars & ground to tunnel car elevators.
12/5/18,Tracking shot of Falcon water landing pic.twitter.com/6Hv2aZhLjM
12/5/18,"Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon. pic.twitter.com/O3h8eCgGJ7"
12/5/18,"Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump & lines."
12/5/18,We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
12/5/18,"Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad."
12/5/18,"Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged & is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched."
12/5/18,Falcon/Dragon launch to @Space_Station in 9 minutes https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1070377864611033088 …
12/4/18,Us too sigh
12/3/18,"Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out & launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim."
12/3/18,64 satellites 🛰 on this flight! https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1069675820770222080 …
12/3/18,"We’re adding police car, fire truck & ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months"
12/3/18,"Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if there’s no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop & turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here."
12/2/18,It is so hard to move in armor!
12/2/18,You’re all hired!
12/2/18,Yes … no … maybe …
12/2/18,None shall pass! https://twitter.com/boringcompany/status/1069044263944511488 …
12/1/18,Ok
12/1/18,Good advice
12/1/18,Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We’re also working on vision-only driving.
12/1/18,Glad you’re ok
12/1/18,"Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth."
12/1/18,"As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic."
12/1/18,"Incoming rocket & fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon"
12/1/18,You got it!
12/1/18,"Three things, one of which is CH4"
12/1/18,No
12/1/18,No
12/1/18,"Reentry scorchmarks, not simple soot. Can’t wipe it off."
12/1/18,Haha
12/1/18,"Prof Dahn is correct (he’s great), but the relative benefit is small. I’d recommend 10% more SoC for convenience."
12/1/18,"Not worth going below 80% imo. Even 90% is still fine. Also, no issue going to 5% or lower SoC."
12/1/18,True ♥️

11/30/18,Both
11/30/18,Your Tesla can function as a boat for brief periods of time https://electrek.co/2016/06/18/tesla-model-s-driving-swimming-flooded-tunnel-video/ …
11/30/18,One day
11/30/18,"We’re doing an EIR for the greater LA tunnel network. Thought we might need a N-S test tunnel (hence Sepulveda proposal), but we’re just going to do rock core samples along that corridor instead."
11/30/18,Update soon
11/29/18,Sorry ☺️
11/29/18,Boring breakthrough @BoringCompany pic.twitter.com/pSflhZadwC
11/29/18,Definitely
11/29/18,"After safety, our goal is to make a Tesla the most fun you could possibly have in a car"
11/29/18,We tried. Nintendo won’t license it to us.
11/29/18,That would be cool
11/29/18,Haha kinda true 😀
11/29/18,Never heard of it
11/29/18,"Super fun software Easter eggs coming to all Tesla S/3/X cars before the holidays! Romance mode, toilet humor & more video games."
11/29/18,Software upgrade to rain sensing neural net coming next month
11/29/18,Yes
11/29/18,"This is completely backwards. Based on what we’ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we’re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA. Won’t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda."
11/29/18,"You can summon your Tesla from your phone. Only short distances today, but in a few years summon will work from across the continent. https://twitter.com/RodneyHansen/status/1067201940352786432 …"
11/28/18,"Cool! Actually, if you buy a Tesla without a test drive, you have 3 days to return it. If you buy after a test drive, you still have 24 hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive. https://twitter.com/crock23a/status/1067530874491715584 …"
11/28/18,Tiny wizard 🧙‍♂️
11/27/18,7 to 10 years
11/27/18,"Engineers, artists & creators of all kinds. There is so much to build."
11/27/18,Touché
11/27/18,"But if you love what you do, it (mostly) doesn’t feel like work"
11/26/18,"Varies per person, but about 80 sustained, peaking above 100 at times. Pain level increases exponentially above 80."
11/26/18,"There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week"
11/26/18,"Join to create exciting new worlds of technology!! If getting things done matters to you, then @SpaceX, @Tesla, @BoringCompany & @Neuralink are the places to be. https://twitter.com/WSJ/status/1067168653718814720 …"
11/26/18,Congratulations! What an amazing track record of success with Mars!
11/26/18,😉😉
11/26/18,1000 liters of pure water costs $1
11/26/18,"For those worried about running out of fresh water, it may help to know that desalination only costs 0.1 cents per liter or half a cent per gallon"
11/26/18,Ah yes fair point
11/26/18,"Used to live in Silicon Valley, now I live in Silicone Valley"
11/26/18,Not yet
11/26/18,🖤 trouble
11/26/18,Earth is
11/26/18,"Earth’s crust is only ~1% of Earth mass, so technically we should be called Lava pic.twitter.com/Lm6doeOq2x"
11/26/18,"Earth should be called Water. Our surface is 71% water. Mars land area is roughly equal to Earth, as it’s all land. Even when warmed up & water ice turns liquid, Mars will be about 2/3 land."
11/26/18,"Yeah, good idea to offer that as a setting"
11/25/18,"Contour remains approx same, but fundamental materials change to airframe, tanks & heatshield"
11/23/18,"If you don’t want a Tesla, here’s a list of all electric cars in North America  https://cleantechnica.com/2018/01/07/electric-vehicles-for-sale-usa/ … via @cleantechnica"
11/22/18,Signing off for a while
11/21/18,Happy Thanksgiving!!
11/21/18,🚀 Starships were meant to fly 🚀 https://m.soundcloud.com/nickiminaj/starships-1 …
11/21/18,Starship Tooters
11/21/18,Good one
11/21/18,Good idea
11/21/18,Coming soon
11/21/18,Shifting resources from sales to service for next several days
11/21/18,Should be next week
11/20/18,"No, it’s the first or boost stage, analogous to, but much larger than Falcon 9"
11/20/18,Later versions will
11/20/18,"Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage & Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)"
11/20/18,Renaming BFR to Starship
11/20/18,"No, we’re just going to accelerate BFR"
11/20/18,Yes
11/19/18,"Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster"
11/19/18,Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
11/19/18,"No, it’s got enough load capacity & volume to carry the battery pack & our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered."
11/19/18,"In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts & processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast"
11/19/18,"What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output."
11/19/18,"Lot on our plate, so it’s either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler & produce sooner or do all & produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster."
11/19/18,Ok
11/19/18,Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That’s a great van. We will inquire.
11/19/18,Absolutely agree
11/19/18,Investigating
11/19/18,Probably mid 2019
11/19/18,Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
11/19/18,"Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not."
11/19/18,Should be possible. Please ask service & lmk response.
11/19/18,"No, but perhaps in a few years"
11/19/18,"Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app."
11/19/18,"Haha, just like Super Troopers"
11/19/18,Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner
11/19/18,Will allow having your car picked up & dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isn’t needed https://twitter.com/NTXTeslaOwners/status/1064524502321778688 …
11/19/18,Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps https://twitter.com/cjk7216/status/1057765681108725760 …
11/17/18,"Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA & USAF are supportive."
11/17/18,Radical change
11/17/18,"Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive."
11/17/18,It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
11/17/18,"Set air flow to recirculating mode & manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times. https://twitter.com/Teslarati/status/1063855556534898689 …"

11/15/18,$5 per min to argue with knight. $12 for 3 min bulk discount.
11/15/18,While (!castle) {brick++};
11/15/18,Watchtower (feat. knight) will be at LA/Hawthorne tunnel entrance
11/15/18,Fortnite irl
11/15/18,Boring Co is launching a whole product line of DIY watchtowers. You get bricks & a picture.
11/15/18,"Um, that is not our castle. I just found a picture on the Internet."
11/15/18,Not much but it is ours pic.twitter.com/gx2l84M3f7
11/15/18,The Boring Company is building a watchtower in LA out of dirt bricks & we need a knight to yell insults at people in a French accent https://www.boringcompany.com/jobs/ 
11/15/18,"We have to truck to departure rail head & truck from arrival rail head, which is usually from customers. Car gets moved around rail yard a lot too & trains don’t leave often."
11/15/18,"Probably some deliveries in March, but April is more certain"
11/15/18,Yes
11/15/18,"Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe & Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently."
11/15/18,We bought some trucking companies & secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
11/15/18,Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
11/15/18,"Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it’s better to use trucks. Single load/unload & direct to owner location."
11/15/18,Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model 3 can be delivered in US by Dec 31 if ordered by Nov 30 https://3.tesla.com/model3/design#battery …
11/14/18,We will fight Big Tequila!
11/14/18,That would be awesome
11/14/18,Easily accessible energy
11/14/18,Send me a note!
11/14/18,Would be fun to add to Tesla
11/14/18,Yes
11/14/18,Will try again next month

11/12/18,"Rest in peace, Stan Lee. The many worlds of imagination & delight you created for humanity will last forever."
11/12/18,Is he ok?
11/11/18,"It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler. https://twitter.com/mayemusk/status/1061412788113825792 …"
11/11/18,Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.
11/10/18,"Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms & partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)"
11/10/18,"Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for “grant money”. They earn 🥜 vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?"
11/10/18,"That is true & should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term."
11/10/18,"We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now & avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far … https://twitter.com/NewsHour/status/1026599623396192256 …"
11/10/18,Because people on the ground know more about what’s actually needed than politicians do
11/10/18,"Good, but not hospital grade. S & X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid & alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model 3."
11/10/18,"If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S & X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people."
11/9/18,"Fair point, will reenable"
11/9/18,"Agreed, top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety."
11/9/18,Please lmk what you’d most like improved/fixed about your Tesla. Thanks!
11/9/18,Cool
11/9/18,"With similar track wheels/tires/brakes, Model S P100D is faster"
11/9/18,Yes
11/8/18,Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.
11/7/18,"No, we’re building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas"
11/7/18,Won’t land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield & high Mach control surfaces are what we can’t test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.
11/7/18,Aiming for orbital flight by June
11/7/18,Mod to SpaceX tech tree build: Falcon 9 second stage will be upgraded to be like a mini-BFR Ship

11/2/18,"To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible."
11/2/18,"Tesla will manufacture all battery modules & packs at China Giga, as we do today in California & Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner."
11/2/18,"Amazing results by @Panasonic at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!"

10/27/18,The FOIA on this will be solid gold. Can’t wait.
10/27/18,Not going up. We will just offer those who ordered bought 3P either $5k back or free lifetime Supercharging.
10/27/18,"It’s a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model 3 Performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. Taking corrective action …"
10/27/18,"Exactly, this is total bs. What part of “production hell” sounds like a sure thing!?"
10/27/18,We will enable track mode for all performance cars
10/27/18,"It was underpriced. Anyway, if you want $5k refund & free Supercharging turned off, we will do that."
10/27/18,"Ok, we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging and give you $5k refund"
10/27/18,"Yeah, or free lifetime Supercharging, whichever you prefer"
10/27/18,Didn’t you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers don’t get that.
10/27/18,Exactly. That’s Monday.
10/27/18,"Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after 10M miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm."
10/27/18,"No, but I will"
10/27/18,Isn’t it obvious?
10/27/18,Worth it
10/27/18,TRUE
10/27/18,Tesla Autopilot Drive on Navigation going to wide release in North America tonight
10/27/18,"Not exactly. We just bundled the upgrade package into Performance. No problem if you want to return the car, but I think lifetime free Supercharging is a good deal."
10/27/18,Haha
10/27/18,"On Insta, 10% of followers like even lame posts. On Twitter, good posts get 1%."

10/27/18,"Reddit’s twitter account is lame, because it’s not real Reddit"
10/27/18,Exactly
10/27/18,You’re right. Earlier Model 3 Performance buyers got free lifetime Supercharging. Will add that to anyone who bought recently.

10/23/18,"There have been hundreds of improvements to fit & finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. Seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past."
10/23/18,Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
10/23/18,Just did that to correct the front design esthetic of Model S. The nose of an electric car shouldn’t look like a radiator grill opening.
10/23/18,"Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that there’s no such thing as a Tesla “refresh”. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week."
10/23/18,"To simplify production, many Tesla Model S & X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want."
10/23/18,"Model 3 body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars"

10/18/18,"It’s kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour, which is really fun to see."
10/18/18,"Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow & ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just don’t use sport/summer tires."

10/17/18,"Yes, aiming for next few months"
10/17/18,"True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months & all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time."
10/17/18,Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
10/17/18,Just reviewed Tesla’s service locations in North America & realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.

10/16/18,"Thanks John, really admire you too! I think you’re one of the best engineers ever. Hope you return to working on rockets one day."
10/16/18,The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
10/16/18,I believe it’s $5k
10/16/18,~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
10/16/18,Somewhere between 500% & 2000%
10/16/18,"To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU & better use of discrete GPU."
10/15/18,"This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude."
10/15/18,Still a long way to go

10/5/18,"Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative — it incents negative gdp!

10/5/18,"Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively & consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market & without clear consent of the shareholder"
10/5/18,"Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors & retirement funds, don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return."
10/5/18,"There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base & gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators"

10/4/18,This is amazing  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nCDVEyKUKd8 …
10/4/18,Almost ready. We expanded the early access program to 1000 more users a few days ago.
10/4/18,"People sometimes forget that a company is just a group of people gathered together to make products. So long as it makes great products, it will have great value."
10/4/18,"If you think Tesla is overvalued compared to probable value of future cash flows, sell. Otherwise, buy."
10/4/18,"Hang in there. If you are truly long-term, it will be fine."
10/4/18,TRUE
10/4/18,Sorry about the typo. That was unforgivable. Why would they be upset about their mission? It’s what they do.
10/4/18,Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!
10/4/18,Great verdict 😀 https://twitter.com/businessinsider/status/1047854644465164288 …
10/2/18,Could be worse 😇
10/2/18,"Tesla Autopilot team is awesome! Got to make sure we iron out the details though. Long tail of tricky edge cases. Important to get front wide angle, B pillar & side repeater camera neural nets just right."
10/2/18,Something especially weird going on with Yahoo news feed on iPhone stocks app. Almost always super negative. Maybe getting gamed.
10/1/18,Naughty by Nature 😉 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=idx3GSL2KWs …
9/29/18,Will do. Definitely moving heavily towards direct to work/home delivery of cars!
9/29/18,Tesla will deliver your car to you. This is the future. The way it should work.

9/28/18,Huge thank you to all Tesla supporters for helping with car deliveries all around the world. You rock!!
9/28/18,Sorry for difficulties delivering your Tesla due to high volume! Critical to show that environmentally sustainable is financially sustainable.
9/26/18,Pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run
9/26/18,You’re welcome. Sorry for the delay!
9/26/18,What would be great is original Elite
9/25/18,Going over final tweaks tonight. Hopefully in wide release end of week.
9/25/18,♥️ Tesla Owners ♥️ https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/998786412970369024 …
9/25/18,"Increased tire pressure improves range. Also, if you have performance tires, they are stickier. Better handling, but slightly lower range."
9/25/18,😀
9/24/18,"Apologies, we’re upgrading our logistics system, but running into an extreme shortage of car carrier trailers. Started building our own car carriers this weekend to alleviate load."
9/24/18,Tricky one
9/22/18,"Wow, thanks for offering to help! The coming week is incredibly intense. If any current Tesla owners who’d like to help educate new owners could head to Tesla delivery centers during midday on Sat/Sun & morning/evening on weekdays, that would be super appreciated!"

9/20/18,"Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car."
9/20/18,"Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear & still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good."
9/20/18,Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia & other important car terms at  https://www.complex.com/sports/2013/03/25-car-terms-you-need-to-know/polar-moment-of-inertia …
9/20/18,"Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling & driving feel. Extremely important metric."
9/20/18,A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
9/20/18,"Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side"
9/20/18,"Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts"
9/20/18,Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details
9/20/18,"Exactly, all 5 star are *not* the same, as the videos show. “5 star” just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much."
9/20/18,Haha true
9/20/18,.@NHTSAgov will post final safety probability stats soon. Model 3 has a shot at being safest car ever tested.
9/20/18,👽💘
9/20/18,"Wow, glad they’re ok!"
9/20/18,Physics can be thought of as the compression algorithms of reality

9/19/18,"Yes, if there is no listener, a simulation probably wouldn’t spend computing power on sound"
9/19/18,Yes
9/19/18,True 😀 https://www.space.com/41871-elon-musk-spacex-bfr-spaceship-science-fiction-legacy.html …
9/19/18,"To conserve computing power, a simulation would only render an object when it is observed"
9/19/18,You’re most welcome! Sorry for the delay.
9/18/18,Will do. Love Reddit.
9/18/18,Space Bar
9/18/18,"Long-term, there will be thousands and eventually, hopefully, millions of missions & anyone will be able to go"
9/18/18,"Yeah, Starlink should be active by then"
9/18/18,Sorry! So many bots!!
9/18/18,"Moon mission will be livestreamed in high def VR, so it’ll feel like you’re there in real-time minus a few seconds for speed of light"
9/18/18,Perhaps one of the invited artists choosing to play. There will be no obligation to do so.

9/17/18,Probably V10 alpha build
9/17/18,"Yes, albeit a beta version. Will improve with V9.1."
9/17/18,Good news on this front. Tesla engineering rallied & this will be part of V9. Going through final testing now.
9/17/18,Thank you for your trust in the @SpaceX team. Greatly appreciated. https://twitter.com/JimBridenstine/status/1041825248872681473 …
9/17/18,Will be interesting to see how this evolves over time
9/17/18,Will see what we can do. Really need to bring this program to an end while being as fair as possible. It’s not sustainable long-term.
9/17/18,Very interesting
9/17/18,"Due to some Tesla owners encountering system issues yesterday, the free Supercharging referral program will be extended until tomorrow night https://twitter.com/joeykrug/status/1041562562607960069 …"
9/17/18,This is definitely worth thoughtful debate. What might we do differently to improve human/life happiness?
9/17/18,"Yes, I do"
9/17/18,Top SpaceX priority is and will remain supporting @NASA crewed spaceflight and National Security missions
9/17/18,"Btw, can’t emphasize enough how @SpaceX would not be where it is today without @NASA. Thank you."

9/17/18,Awesome 😎
9/17/18,"Design has been changed so the 🚀 lands on legs that extend from the tips of the three fins, two of which actuate (mostly for pitch control)"
9/17/18,"Sorry, it’s not really sustainable at volume production & doesn’t incent optimal behavior. We probably should have ended this earlier."
9/16/18,Yes
9/16/18,"Yeah, that’s our problem. Service & parts supply in general will be the top Tesla priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few weeks."
9/16/18,"Outside repair shops are jack of all trades, which means supporting 1000’s of makes & models. Tesla collision repair specializes in three. Having all parts in stock & not waiting for insurance approval also make a world of difference."
9/16/18,Goal is for repaired car to be better than before accident. Should always be true if damaged/used parts are correctly replaced with newer parts.
9/16/18,"Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within 24 hrs. Aiming for same day soon, then under an hour."
9/16/18,"Tesla is bringing most collision repairs in-house, as outside firms take weeks to months for repairs, driving Tesla owners (and us) crazy"

8/31/18,"The multi-coat colors (pearl white & red) are hardest, red especially, as it has red tint in the clear coat layer itself for depth & complexity"
8/31/18,"Sorry, we’ve put pretty extreme rules in place for paint & quality in general. If need be, we’re repainting/replacing entire sections of car or building whole new cars. Got to be done."

8/28/18,So you actually did nothing & yet imply you are a truth-seeker. The Twitter name you chose is @yoda.
8/28/18,"Answer the question @yoda. You brought it up, not me. Did you investigate or not? If so, what did you actually do?"
8/28/18,"At this point, I want ETH even if it is a scam"
8/28/18,Did you investigate at all? I’m guessing answer is no. Why?

8/25/18,This is utterly false. Fossil fuel merchants of doubt have been pushing that bs for years. Tesla Gigafactory will be 100% renewable powered (by Tesla Solar) by end of next year.
8/25/18,"Most people don’t realize that the cost of operating an electric vehicle is much lower than a gas car. Electricity is way cheaper than gas plus no oil changes, tune-ups,smog checks & other service costs."
8/25/18,"Most major customers have tried it & love it. Now we need to finish production design & build it, while avoiding dumb mistakes made with Model 3 production system. Wish it wasn’t so hard to be less stupid over time …"
8/25/18,Maybe …
8/25/18,"This was key showstopper for me personally. Couldn’t make it happen, even through expert fiduciary SPV, without creating exotic trust structure that would prob not be accepted by regulators. Current rules have good intentions, but make wealth creation harder for small investors."
8/25/18,"The extension cord was 1000 miles long, but still"
8/25/18,"What’s cool is that it was driven across the country alone (no escort or any accompanying vehicles), using the existing Tesla Supercharger network and an extension cord"
8/25/18,"In talking to our public investors, most were supportive of optimizing for long-term value creation over quarterly earnings. This was also a factor in remaining public."

8/7/18,No change
8/7/18,Shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares & go private
8/7/18,Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
8/7/18,My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if we’re private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity’s SpaceX investment.
8/7/18,Yes
8/7/18,I don’t have a controlling vote now & wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won’t be selling in either scenario.

8/1/18,Please send examples of prior work when applying. Looking for max playability & creativity.
8/1/18,"If you’re into video game development, consider applying to Tesla. We want to make super fun games that integrate the center touch screen, phone & car irl."
8/1/18,😛
8/1/18,Cool idea!
8/1/18,Good idea & thanks for Supercharger trophy reminder. Really want to make the car as fun as possible!
8/1/18,Yup

7/23/18,We’ve gone from ~1000 S/X deliveries per week in US last year to ~6000 S/3/X. It’s like hitting a square wave.
7/23/18,"We’re trying to get rid of contracts completely. Should just be “tap here & you get your car”. Then, if you don’t like it for any reason, just return it like any other product."
7/23/18,Yeah. Never seen it so high ever.
7/23/18,"Wow, that’s really awesome. Thank you! ♥️@TeslaOwnersUK"
7/23/18,Haha
7/23/18,"Looks good, but so many details need to be right. Journey back from hypersonic becomes extremely difficult as velocity increases. Altitude is easy, velocity is hard."
7/23/18,Only costs that actually apply to Q3 & beyond will be counted. It would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter.

7/23/18,Congratulations to all teams in the student @Hyperloop competition! To make high-speed pods that can operate in vacuum is very difficult. Was great to meet everyone!
7/22/18,"Exactly. Overheat protection is always on, but you can also tap “maintain” & your car will hold a cool or warm temp for a few hours while parked."

7/21/18,Don’t make me bite my thumb at you
7/21/18,For sure
7/21/18,"Btw, 1792 is calling & wants its method of execution back. Seriously, what museum do you plan to raid?"
7/21/18,"Yeah, great point. Underground power lines would clear up the skyline, be safer to service, have better uptime & save lives of many birds."

7/21/18,"Yes, that will probably be its first use"
7/21/18,"Phew 😅. Yeah, we had a drain block 3 months ago & people are working hard to make Tesla successful. Am honored to work with them. Are you trolling for fun or is it part of a job? What motivates you?"
7/21/18,I apologized. Do you stand by your guillotine statement or not?
7/20/18,"Figuratively, literally or both?"
7/20/18,That has always been our goal
7/20/18,"This chart only shows globally competed commercial launches, not US government missions. “Other US” refers to Boeing & Lockheed. Their skill at obtaining govt contracts & subsidies vastly exceeds ours."
7/20/18,"Dunno where this bs is coming from. Who knows about the future, but last week we had over 2000 S/X and 5000 Model 3 *new* net orders."
7/20/18,Definitely. We gave up some grip & width in exchange for range. Would recommend stickier tires & wider on rear for best performance. You might get 3.3 sec 0-60 mph or better with optimized rims & tires.
7/18/18,"Wow, someone has really thought about this!"

7/17/18,Good point
7/15/18,I have never donated to a SuperPAC
7/15/18,"Yes, about 0.5% of what I donated to @SierraClub, which is a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue"
7/15/18,Reports that I am a top donor to GOP are categorically false. I am not a top donor to any political party.
7/15/18,Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth. https://twitter.com/sierraclub/status/1018319251428577280 …
7/15/18,"That said, I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes."
7/14/18,So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity
7/14/18,"Thanks Jack. To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent & politically moderate. Doesn’t mean I’m moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me & I don’t understand why they are not important to everyone."
7/14/18,Actually true

7/12/18,The pumps I saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave 3. They stopped shortly after boys were rescued & water level rose to roof level all way back to cave 1. That was great work.
7/12/18,Sounds good
7/12/18,Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications.
7/11/18,It will happen for sure. Damn.
7/11/18,Should drive temp to target. Why fan speed on app?
7/11/18,Lots of fake accounts on Twitter characterized by high following/follower ratio to make it seem like many real people when it isn’t. Wonder why.
7/11/18,"Damn, now I want donuts 🍩"
7/11/18,Yeah
7/11/18,Good point. Maybe use non-plumbers with work inspected/approved by pros.
7/11/18,"You’re right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water, but they’ve lost faith in govt test results. Some houses are still outliers. Will organize a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues & hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good."
7/11/18,Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation?
7/11/18,"For now, reply to my tweet with ppm & ppb test results & will send someone to install a water filter. Creating email flint@x.com, but I’m in China so that won’t be working until tomorrow."
7/11/18,Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels. No kidding.
7/11/18,Great move

7/11/18,Stockholm: it’s not just a syndrome
7/11/18,Good point

7/11/18,"Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump & generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue."
7/11/18,It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
7/11/18,Makes a lot of sense
7/11/18,This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option & worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it’s there for anyone who needs it in future. Something’s messed up if this is not a good thing.
7/11/18,I think the person who attacked me on Twitter will survive somehow
7/11/18,Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.
7/10/18,Please lmk contamination levels of any kind when you test the water
7/10/18,Please lmk results of your water tests
7/10/18,"When you’re there next week, are you planning to test water sources for lead?"
7/10/18,Should be very soon. We’ve already made around 100 Model 3 Performance cars for test drives in stores.
7/10/18,Exactly
7/10/18,"No, it means I created jobs for 50,000 people directly and, through parts suppliers & supporting professions, ~250,000 people indirectly, thus supporting half a million families. What have you done?"
7/10/18,Already have
7/10/18,"Ironically, the “billionaire” label, when used by media, is almost always meant to devalue & denigrate the subject. I wasn’t called that until my companies got to a certain size, but reality is that I still do the same science & engineering as before. Just the scale has changed."
7/10/18,"Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry & at std air pressure entire time."
7/10/18,"Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point"
7/10/18,"Moreover, based on extensive cave video review & discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey & demonstrate at any time."
7/10/18,"The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as “rescue chief”) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence: pic.twitter.com/dmC9l3jiZR"

7/10/18,Ok
7/9/18,Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts & named Wild Boar after kids’ soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful. pic.twitter.com/EHNh8ydaTT
7/9/18,That would be cool. I wonder what it’s like under all that ice.
7/9/18,A second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete
7/9/18,Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
7/9/18,"According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage."

7/8/18,"Thanks, but we’ve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people."
7/8/18,"According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages"
7/8/18,Tube diameter is 31cm
7/8/18,"Mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
7/8/18,Thanks @palicharterhigh for letting us use your pool
7/8/18,It is an honor to work with them

7/8/18,I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz …
7/8/18,It is both alarming & explanatory that you run a psych ward
7/8/18,"Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections."
7/8/18,"Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio & phone/music player."
7/8/18,"Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm."
7/8/18,pic.twitter.com/jL2sPT0NCp
7/8/18,Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. They’re prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold attachments.
7/8/18,"Testing for 3 more hours in LA, then it’s on a plane to Thailand"
7/8/18,"Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): 4 air / oxygen ports front & rear, front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to 10X cave water pressure."
7/8/18,I am an engineer
7/8/18,Tight control code is always C
7/8/18,Python is done right. Great name story too.
7/8/18,"If I am a narcissist (which might be true), at least I am a useful one"
7/8/18,🖤🖤🖤 Python 🖤🖤🖤
7/8/18,Pretty close. There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit.
7/8/18,Turbo
7/8/18,C
7/8/18,"Given Chiang Rai airport hours, soonest we could’ve departed US was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future."
7/8/18,"Will do. Even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
7/8/18,Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed. https://twitter.com/bbcbreaking/status/1015811558851661825 …
7/8/18,Yes
7/7/18,Yes
7/7/18,Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights & adjust bouyancy.
7/7/18,Yes
7/7/18,"4 handles/hitch points on front & 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front & 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops."
7/7/18,I’m in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
7/7/18,"Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand"
7/7/18,"Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience & tenacity of kids & diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best."
7/7/18,"Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust."
7/7/18,Ground winds would
7/7/18,Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. It’s a beast.
7/7/18,Can’t be too buoyant
7/7/18,"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."
7/6/18,Good idea
7/6/18,"Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod & vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary & less susceptible to panic attack."
7/6/18,You’re welcome. Happy birthday! 🎁🎉🎂
7/6/18,"Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about in that tweet — double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying."
7/6/18,Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube & rock wall.
7/6/18,It’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
7/6/18,"Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
7/6/18,I would def recommend this
7/6/18,Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks & front/rear rope tow hitch & lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
7/6/18,Interesting
7/6/18,"Great, thanks"
7/6/18,Inflatable tubes & pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand & is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
7/6/18,"So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out & water won’t come in"
7/6/18,"Does you know output voltage & amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
7/6/18,SpaceX & Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
7/6/18,"Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd & 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps & tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up & then transit."
7/6/18,"So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power."
7/6/18,Have a small velcro slit entrance & exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
7/6/18,"Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you’re in an air tube, time doesn’t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
7/6/18,Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network & inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof & auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
7/5/18,Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for & parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.
7/5/18,"I know you & believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said"
7/5/18,I didn’t ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots don’t work for me. They just don’t like hypocrites.
7/5/18,They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I don’t use Facebook.
7/5/18,Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was “dancing her face off” with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true? http://www.norwichbulletin.com/article/20140516/NEWS/305169979 …
7/5/18,Why did @lopezlinette publish a love letter puff piece about Chanos’s cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective http://www.businessinsider.com/jim-chanos-sweet-chinese-yuan-cufflinks-2014-5 …

7/5/18,.@Lopezlinette posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos & Tepper with caption “Love both these dudes”. Doesn’t sound very objective http://www.dodgeglobe.com/article/20140516/News/305169981 …
7/5/18,"Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so."
7/5/18,Are you 100% certain that @businessinsider stands by @lopezlinette & supports everything she’s done? Why won’t Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
7/5/18,Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
7/5/18,TRUE
7/5/18,"So @lopezlinette publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Tesla’s most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is “one of the greatest.” Her articles print Chanos’s view verbatim. This is not journalism."
7/5/18,".@lopezlinette You stated publicly that you “see eye to eye” with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?"
7/5/18,What a coincidence …
7/5/18,Am not attacking all media or even all of @CNBC. Just asked if you inform public about an analyst’s prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
7/5/18,"Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: @lopezlinette, did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?"
7/5/18,"Exactly. @cnbc, I just asked a simple question. Please answer."
7/5/18,"Strange. @cnbc, is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings & extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst’s track record before hearing their opinion."
7/5/18,"Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself. https://twitter.com/tesla/status/1014515503740567553 …"
7/5/18,"Sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette, is it possible you’re  serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla’s biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him & he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?"
7/5/18,"@lopezlinette has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &3 production number, which is physically impossible."
7/5/18,"Wow, so @sal19 of @Reuters wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production & followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work @sal19 & @Reuters."
7/5/18,".@Reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number?"
7/5/18,".@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target."

6/25/18,We must aspire to truth
6/25/18,Important to read the Wash Post article. The “unable to account for” number does not refer to actual lost children. It refers to calls not answered or returned in a 30 day period.
6/25/18,Hopefully in V9.0 release in a few months
6/25/18,TRUE
6/25/18,"We should always be concerned about the welfare of children & those who cannot protect themselves, wherever they may be, but it seems much of the reporting on this issue has been partisan & often inaccurate"
6/25/18,"“… of the 7,635 children, 6,075 remained where they were placed, 52 had moved, 28 had run away and five were deported. That left 1,475 migrant children. Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHS’s phone calls after 30 days does not mean the children are missing”"
6/25/18,"“All 7,635 children were resettled by HHS. After 30 days, the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law, and in 1,475 cases, the parents or guardians did not respond”"

6/17/18,Search UAW and “corruption”. Very long reading list. Great organization. https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/chrysler/2018/04/05/feds-raided-uaw-leader-house-amid-corruption-probe/33579403/ …
6/17/18,“Profit” just means you earned more money than you spent & certainly does spark innovation. Jesus. This is obv a good thing & extremely hard. It has taken Tesla 15 years & we’re almost there. Every other US car company besides Ford & Tesla has gone bankrupt.
6/17/18,They don’t seem to think much or care about the future beyond a narrow horizon
6/17/18,Engels wrote 2nd & 3rd volumes based on Marx’s “notes”. Less reliable.
6/17/18,"Wanted to help transition the world to sustainable, clean energy and extend life as we know it beyond Earth. Those problems require a lot of hardware."
6/17/18,"Wow, you know nothing & are worthy of contempt. The world is under massive attack due to climate change & you couldn’t care less."

6/17/18,"You’re just a troll/bot, but I will reply anyway. I arrived in Montreal at 17 by myself with $2k. No support, no contacts, nothing. Father said I’d fail & be back in 3 months."
6/17/18,"I don’t want to see anyone lose their money. Or I will at least provide fair warning before it happens, as I have done in the past."
6/17/18,You think all companies are bad and all unions good? That’s a very bigoted position.
6/17/18,Well said https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2018/5/29/1767826/-The-War-on-Tesla-Musk-and-the-Fight-for-the-Future …
6/17/18,Then you’ll be fine
6/17/18,Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter & simpler than most.
6/17/18,"...which clearly doesn’t work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what’s happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they’re getting desperate."
6/17/18,"Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread."
6/17/18,More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
6/17/18,How big is your short position? Just curious.
6/17/18,Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda & hand them to me. This one guy’s claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
6/17/18,"I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest & failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right."
6/17/18,"UAW doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they’re getting paid trolls & far left shills to trash Tesla & me in press & social media. Such creeps."
6/17/18,"I’m not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can’t compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don’t want Tesla to die too."
6/17/18,"I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people."
6/17/18,"Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult."
6/17/18,"Iain certainly wasn’t pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldn’t be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through & through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but that’s a special case."

6/16/18,"If I’m not a communist, why do I make red cars 🚘 🤔"
6/16/18,"Very appealing if you’re a sophomore in college. It’s a counterpoint to communism and useful as such, but should be tempered with kindness."
6/16/18,That is why it is critical to support competition. Excess profits draw in competitors who then drive down prices.

6/16/18,Sigh
6/16/18,"By the way, I am actually a socialist. Just not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm. True socialism seeks greatest good for all."

6/16/18,No
6/16/18,My father has no money. Only reason he even has a house is because my brother & I bought it for him on condition that he not cause harm to others. That obviously failed.
6/15/18,"There is considerable confusion between wealth as consumption & wealth as labor allocation. By latter measure, anyone in govt whose budget exceeds $1B is a billionaire. Government is the largest corporation."
6/15/18,Socialism vs capitalism is not even the right question. What really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict people’s freedom.
6/15/18,Universal income will be necessary over time if AI takes over most human jobs
6/15/18,Marx was a capitalist. He even wrote a book about it.

6/10/18,Thanks! Have heard universally great things about your podcasts.

6/10/18,"Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons"
6/10/18,"Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It’s what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust — literally bulletproof."
6/10/18,Not recommended for urban environments
6/10/18,Yes
6/10/18,"The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what I’m thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda."
6/10/18,It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.
6/10/18,Love this design. Simpler the better.
6/10/18,Add an R for Roadster 👽💕🚀
6/10/18,"Sigh. This is crux of matter: can’t make system too annoying or people won’t use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can’t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially."
6/10/18,A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.
6/10/18,"Yes. Hopefully, I’m not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing."
6/10/18,Will do
6/10/18,"Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there’s no escaping Newton’s Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) & O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha."
6/10/18,"You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don’t think there will be another."
6/10/18,"Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time."
6/10/18,"Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the “halo crown” effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric."
6/10/18,"That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now & fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features."
6/10/18,"This is why I’m not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then I’d know everything’s fine & no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh 🤔"
6/10/18,"Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional & city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe & Knight-Ridder websites. NYT, KR & Hearst were all major investors in Zip2."
6/10/18,20 years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory & a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your 🧠 like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?€}%$& fetch_joystick_state function.
6/10/18,"In early 90s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU & CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly & direct flipping of CPU registers. That company’s name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony."
6/10/18,"That’s quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014, we open-sourced all Tesla patents https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you …"
6/9/18,"At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps & calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages & business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading & real estate apps."

6/9/18,"We don’t think our product will be the cause of any wildfires, but The Boring Company is donating $10k."
6/9/18,"Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further."
6/9/18,"19 years ago, when my 1st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 & a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way…"

5/30/18,You’re most welcome. More to come in this regard.
5/30/18,"Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading & point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description, but Consumer Reports is always fair & accurate in their criticism."
5/30/18,"Ride comfort & aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day 1, but there’s always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure 10% below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%."

5/29/18,"“Nano” is a unit of measure, not a field imo. Would’ve been sexist *not* to express an opinion simply because someone is a woman."
5/29/18,"Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying I’m against science is like saying Beyoncé doesn’t know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue."
5/29/18,"Gaiman, did you actually read my tweets? I didn’t set anyone on anyone. A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was anti-science & I said that was false. Are you saying I don’t have the right to deny false accusations? That’s messed up."
5/29/18,"You’ve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that I’m against science, then cherrypicked tweets that don’t represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too"
5/29/18,Great book. Read it when it came out.
5/29/18,Exactly
5/29/18,SpaceX has Area 58 at Cape Canaveral. That’s 7 better than 51.
5/29/18,Yeah
5/29/18,Second best answer to the Fermi Paradox after the simulation argument
5/29/18,Which part? Love their cuisine. And the views are amazing.
5/29/18,Yes
5/29/18,"There are no aliens. Officially, at least …"
5/29/18,You have so many great pics & factoids!
5/29/18,"Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions & not lose money."
5/29/18,I really want to make this cupholder
5/29/18,"A dream that wd prob be a nightmare in reality. Cup holder that auto adjusted for size & stiffness of cup/bottle, maintained cold or hot temp & dried off water condensation. Or I cd work on getting humanity to Mars. Tough choice."
5/29/18,I’ve literally had dreams about cup holder designs
5/29/18,Noted. We can prob adjust spring force & catch to be less sensitive. Cupholders are amazingly hard to get right!
5/28/18,You’re welcome. Appreciate the letter.
5/28/18,Good school
5/28/18,Had a great time with my kids
5/28/18,Yes
5/28/18,"Seems to be glitch where tweet to which I replied isn’t showing up, removing context. A journo said polls are meaningless because controlled by “powerful people” & my response was that powerful people also own media. Thus, if you discount polls, you should also discount media. pic.twitter.com/c01JolZENY"
5/28/18,Thanks 😀
5/28/18,2020
5/28/18,Superchargers will ultimately cover the entire region
5/28/18,"Pointing out to aspiring journo & Rodin spokesmodel, Josh Top, who thinks public polls are controlled by “powerful people” that the media is *owned* by same. Anyone who thought this was anti-Semitic is just revealing their inner bigot. The context is very clear."
5/28/18,Thanks for offering to help. I will check with my team.
5/27/18,You’re right. These guys can buzzkill themselves (pun intended). Signing off …
5/27/18,Who do you think *owns* the press? Hello.
5/27/18,You’re missing the point & living in a bubble of self-righteous sanctimony. The public doesn’t trust you. This was true *before* the last election & only got worse. Don’t believe me? Run your own poll …
5/27/18,"You’re welcome to come by SpaceX, but please stop assuming I’m against all journalists. This is not true. Something needs to be done to improve public trust in media."
5/27/18,You really think I haven’t spent time in a newsroom? I’ve spent time in too many. Bleak.
5/27/18,"Sadly, it had better critical analysis than most non-cult media"
5/27/18,"Yup, deleted"
5/27/18,? It should
5/27/18,"No, but dual motors mean increased regen braking & will ride tire traction limit. You won’t notice sport brakes unless you’re on a racetrack & have the sticky 20” tires."
5/27/18,"Also, firmware fix for upgraded brake performance on standard Model 3 started rolling out yesterday. Should improve braking distance by ~20 ft for repeated heavy braking events. Thanks @ConsumerReports for excellent critical feedback!"
5/27/18,"Yes, Model 3 Performance will have red calipers & sport level brakes"

5/26/18,Because Twitter is fun
5/26/18,USAToday FTW!
5/26/18,Dank is wack unless you’re on weed
5/26/18,"Exactly. And NYT could have anyone post an Op Ed. Why, of all people, are they choosing to publish this “non-journalist” who is also pro gasoline cars? Is this just published as counterpoint? I assume NYT does believe in climate change?"
5/26/18,But femtotech is the future …  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtotechnology …
5/26/18,Nanotech is so 2008. Picotech is 1000 times better.
5/26/18,"Yeah, that’s exactly right. But after suggesting public critique, I was stunned to see the level of contempt many in media have for their readers. This is way worse than I thought. https://twitter.com/bonnienorman/status/1000470928067776512 …"
5/26/18,The arguments journos are using against the public are word for word the same arguments despots use against democracy
5/26/18,Well said. NYT journo is outraged that “dumb” public wd dare critique him while attacking me for being sensitive to criticism. Uhh... https://twitter.com/ritnagar/status/1000450938220376064 …
5/26/18,A Tesla has a usable reserve of 5 to 15 miles range even after the battery reads “empty”. This will not hurt the pack.
5/26/18,"Pretty good. TinTin A & B are both closing the link to ground w phased array at high bandwidth, low latency (25 ms). Good enough to play fast response video games."

5/26/18,"Stop trying to charm me. It won’t work. Ok, maybe a little 😊 Are you a real person or a bot?"
5/26/18,"Using “rocket science” non-ironically in a bio is never a good sign, especially if you work on 🚀🔬"
5/26/18,What are you talking about? You’re being incredibly rude & nonsensical.
5/26/18,"Wow, haven’t watched that video in ages. When we made that, no one in the space industry thought it would actually happen."
5/26/18,"Generally higher quality reporting, especially if not under pressure to publish fast. Consumer Reports is great (and often critical of Tesla). Heard good things about The Information too."

5/25/18,You’re making my point. It’s tragic that there’s a national nano day. I wish I didn’t know that.
5/25/18,All four. Zone 3 throughput was solved a couple of weeks ago.
5/25/18,Model 3 was designed for min engineering & tooling change for RHD. Note left/right symmetry. LHD for Europe & Asia first half of next year. RHD probably middle of next year.
5/25/18,This is the new production line for battery module Zone 4. Will play a key role in getting from 3000/week to 6000/week for Model 3.
5/25/18,I have never attacked science. Definitely attacked misleading journalism like yours though.
5/25/18,"Pravda was incorporated a year ago. Also, Tesla factory safety has improved every year & is now better than industry avg. Misleading articles refer to Tesla being worse than avg in 2015 when we were just figuring things out."
5/25/18,Worth a shot
5/25/18,Of course! (Prav)Duh. It is named after the most pernicious propaganda machine in history specifically to highlight what we want to avoid. It’s called “satire” …
5/25/18,"This is going to help journalism, not harm it. Please be so kind as to hold your fire until you actually see it."
5/25/18,"Problem solved, was able to buy  http://Pravduh.com ! Game on …"
5/25/18,"I know, I know. Russia seriously didn’t correct me on this!"
5/25/18,"Something needs to be done to reward consistent, high quality journalism. Some in media are absurdly indignant before even seeing the product. Odd …"
5/25/18,"Turns out  http://Pravda.com  is actually owned by Ukraine. For some reason, Russia didn’t bother to correct me …"
5/25/18,"For some reason, Russia didn’t bother to correct me …"
5/25/18,"Tried to buy  http://Pravda.com , but Russia said no. Turns out they already use it."
5/25/18,"Definitely did not. I’ve been through many press cycles & know full well same person praising me today will trash me tomorrow. Journos hound me constantly for interviews, but I do almost none these days. ♥️ Twitter as it allows me to bypass journo bs."
5/25/18,I’ve just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest & yet believe that same public is too stupid & immoral to assess their credibility. It’s amazing that you don’t understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.
5/25/18,The Tesla facility is open plan & we’re not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well & they are some of the worst & best human beings I’ve ever met. You’re the former.
5/25/18,No
5/25/18,Nano applies to everything & therefore means nothing. Definitely indicates bs. Sorry.  http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Nanotechnology …
5/24/18,"Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world & products that haven’t been unveiled yet. You don’t have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches."
5/24/18,"Wow, you’re ignorant. Don’t remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law & land you in jail. I didn’t review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please."
5/24/18,Done
5/24/18,Have a confirmed real name identity section & an unconfirmed identity section. Latter with subscore that excludes probable botnets.
5/24/18,Be careful what you wish for https://m.imdb.com/title/tt3333824/ …
5/24/18,"Amazingly, the “media is awesome” vote is declining, despite hundreds of articles attacking this very poll🤔"
5/24/18,My point exactly https://twitter.com/rockypruitt/status/999535383049273344 …
5/24/18,"Ahem, you have “nano” in your bio. That is 100% synonymous with bs."
5/24/18,Reddit is great
5/24/18,"Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media."
5/24/18,Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don’t realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
5/24/18,"Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt."
5/24/18,I did to any who asked
5/24/18,"That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product & it didn’t work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it."
5/24/18,"Maybe after you get your Model 3, we can talk about what you like & what needs to be improved"
5/24/18,"But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so March 15 is about right."
5/24/18,"I just made that up, because the Ides of March sounded good"
5/24/18,Gasoline or diesel?
5/24/18,What car do you drive?
5/24/18,15-Mar
5/24/18,The media
5/24/18,"Hi Kara! I’m open to it. Right now, I’m cranking super hard at the Tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week."
5/24/18,"Maybe the media credibility rating site should be called “You’re Right!”  I do actually own  http://youreright.com , but for the moment I just have it automatically forward to Facebook News."
5/24/18,Definitely
5/24/18,"There no good car emojis. I mean seriously, what the heck are these 🚗 🚙 and this is the best one 🚘"
5/24/18,Yo
5/24/18,That’s the basic idea
5/24/18,"For some reason, this is the best I’ve felt in a while. Hope you’re feeling good too 🚀♥️🌏"
5/24/18,"I just tried to donate, but you don’t accept PayPal. Lmk when you do."
5/23/18,"Um, you just tweeted about this, so obv you do"
5/23/18,Thank you! I thought it was so obvious …
5/23/18,Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.
5/23/18,"Yeah, I think you do great work"
5/23/18,"If you’re in media & don’t want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it …"
5/23/18,🤗
5/23/18,"I’ve never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived & gave people back their jobs. They haven’t forgotten UAW betrayed them. That’s why UAW can’t even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote."
5/23/18,Of course
5/23/18,"It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla & millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but we’re doing our best to make clean energy real & be a good company."
5/23/18,"No, they’re just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously"
5/23/18,Will do
5/23/18,Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
5/23/18,That’s why editors are included too
5/23/18,We don’t. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
5/23/18,"Even if some of the public doesn’t care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors & publications will. It is how they define themselves."
5/23/18,Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
5/23/18,Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
5/23/18,"Not only needs to be botproof, but seek & unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army"
5/23/18,Exactly
5/23/18,"Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article & track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor & publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda …"
5/23/18,An exception that proves the rule
5/23/18,"Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?"
5/23/18,"Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks & earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies & gas/diesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers."
5/23/18,The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
5/23/18,Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he’s above criticism. Try being truthful & the public will believe you again.
5/23/18,"Thought you’d say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks “You’re just like Trump!” Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago."
5/23/18,"The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them https://twitter.com/electrekco/status/999318852365303808 …"
5/23/18,"This will sound super obvious, but Genesis & Oblivion"
5/23/18,I am not cool
5/23/18,The one about to come out called So Heavy i fell through the earth
5/23/18,"Was sad to see G getting tons of undeserved flak because of me, so I’m glad there’s some good too ♥️🎼🐇. Her music is incredible."
5/23/18,Thanks. Not super fun right now 😔
5/23/18,Busted 👻
5/23/18,"None of those criteria are certain by themselves, but when taken together & messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts"
5/23/18,"Troll dead giveaways: not using real names, obv fake pics & backgrounds, low follower/follow ratio, account recently created, repeating same phrases, etc (sigh)"
5/22/18,Great idea!
5/22/18,Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.
5/22/18,Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
5/22/18,Interesting he stops at ‘09. That’s when you drove GM & Chrysler into bankruptcy & lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you.
5/22/18,Just order your car with the James Bond option package. It’s an off-menu item for those in the know 😉
5/22/18,"But ya know what, let’s test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago & left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them & wages were lower. Maybe. Let’s hold a vote & find out."
5/22/18,"In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM & Chrysler to bankruptcy & lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over & now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry & everyone knows it."
5/22/18,"We’re going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X & 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?"
5/22/18,Good point
5/22/18,"No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness & enforcement of 2 class “lords & commoners” system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers & workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much."
5/22/18,"More “Reveal” bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, & they’ve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler & GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article …"
5/22/18,No problem
5/22/18,"They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet."
5/22/18,"Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!"
5/22/18,I didn’t meet with him
5/22/18,I definitely don’t do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can’t be creative otherwise.
5/22/18,Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
5/22/18,"Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn’t fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars."
5/22/18,"Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced."
5/22/18,"To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today’s Model S is far more refined than initial production."
5/22/18,ABS calibration algorithm
5/22/18,"Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise & many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production."
5/22/18,"Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car."
5/22/18,"Stop, you’re making me blush ☺️"
5/22/18,"Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little"
5/22/18,Complexity is the devil. Words can’t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp & trying to get to profitability. But we’ll try.
5/22/18,"Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations."
5/22/18,"The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3’s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we’ve seen anything like this."
5/22/18,"Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3’s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers"
5/22/18,"Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance & others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out & address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update."
5/21/18,"Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers & beeping forklifts you said didn’t exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar@tesla.com."
5/21/18,Gwynne’s awesome. Been SpaceX prez for 10 years. Super love working with her.
5/21/18,♥️🦄
5/21/18,"Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs."
5/21/18,Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare.
5/21/18,"Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines & tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as “facts” by Reveal."
5/21/18,We’re working on allowing you to use your phone in car when you hear a rattle/squeak & pinpoint origin by acoustic signature & triangulation

5/21/18,For sure before snowfall this year
5/21/18,It can tow far more than rated capacity
5/21/18,Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
5/21/18,"With production, 1st you need achieve target rate & then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money & die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla & live."
5/21/18,That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
5/21/18,Exactly 🚀💫🎉! That will be really fun & shed light on what’s happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
5/21/18,"Yeah, “Reveal” was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today’s non-union."
5/21/18,"About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried & hourly, union & non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally & on social media & lied about it."
5/20/18,Yes
5/20/18,Exactly
5/20/18,They can form a union whenever they want & there’s nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don’t want to.
5/20/18,Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It’s like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
5/20/18,"They are correct. It’s awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight."
5/20/18,"It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can’t tell"
5/20/18,Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
5/20/18,"Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now."
5/20/18,Good idea ...
5/20/18,That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
5/20/18,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front & a motor in rear. One is optimized for power & one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination & don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
5/20/18,Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec & top speed to 140 mph.
5/20/18,Black & white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
5/20/18,"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
5/20/18,"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker & with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
5/20/18,"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3:
3.5 sec  0-60mph 
155 mph Top Speed
310 mile Range"
5/20/18,"It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
5/20/18,Exactly
5/20/18,Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself & zero paperwork.
5/20/18,I’m about to test the configurator & then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight
5/20/18,"You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards"
5/20/18,That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!
5/20/18,"Also, carbon fiber spoiler, 20” Performance wheels, black & white interior."
5/20/18,"AC induction front & switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output & get double the burn-in."
5/19/18,Working on Model 3 dual motor all-wheel drive & performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.

5/18/18,Excited for @boringcompany partnership with LA Metro https://twitter.com/metrolosangeles/status/991116223424286721 …

5/17/18,Listening to REALiTi
5/17/18,"Yeah, there are thousands of Supercharger locations going through permitting/construction, including that area. Will publish an updated map in the next few days."
5/16/18,Yes
5/16/18,Will be presenting & taking questions  about The Boring Company plans for Los Angeles at 7pm on Thursday
5/16/18,Boring Company Hyperloop will take you from city center under ground & ocean to spaceport in 10 to 15 mins https://twitter.com/tedtalks/status/988501449586987008 …
5/14/18,"Time will tell, but so far it appears so"
5/14/18,"It certainly needs to be better & we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives & reduces injuries should be released."
5/14/18,What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
5/14/18,"It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage  https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/tesla-with-autopilot-slams-into-truck-stopped-at-red-light/2018/05/12/18d2e740-563e-11e8-a6d4-ca1d035642ce_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.7466cb626644 …"
5/14/18,Yes
5/14/18,"According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It’s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
5/14/18,"This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg."
5/14/18,Happy Mother’s Day Mom! Love you so much.
5/14/18,"Fair criticism, but we’re fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix 2 worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising."
5/14/18,Lovely story https://twitter.com/teslarati/status/995563083203571712 …
5/13/18,"If someone is trying to control us through complicated sky patterns, they must really care. I would gladly obey their instructions, but I can’t figure them out."
5/13/18,"SpaceX will prob build 30 to 40 rocket cores for ~300 missions over 5 years. Then BFR takes over & Falcon retires. Goal of BFR is to enable anyone to move to moon, Mars & eventually outer planets."
5/13/18,Good piece by Ars https://twitter.com/arstechnica/status/995457711398678529 …
5/12/18,Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing
5/12/18,"Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines — quaint, but not something you’d actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines & trains in general."
5/12/18,"Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them."
5/12/18,Yo
5/11/18,Will make that a setting
5/11/18,"Fossil fuels subsidized at $10 million a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/18/fossil-fuel-companies-getting-10m-a-minute-in-subsidies-says-imf …"
5/11/18,No use arguing with chimp. You’re blocked.
5/11/18,"That article was pushed as propaganda to counter IMF study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be $5 trillion/year. Even if $4.9B was true, combined market cap of Tesla & SpaceX is $80B. Where did the other $75B come from? Ass 🎩 …"
5/11/18,I have publicly asked people (like you) not to invest. Go fund Ford or whatever  …
5/11/18,Launching in ~4 mins https://twitter.com/spacex/status/995031117924257792 …
5/11/18,"AWD & white interior in July. Air suspension prob later. Note, that’s when we *start* making them. Can’t instantly fill all orders. Will take 6+ months to do so."
5/11/18,"Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange …"
5/11/18,"I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp"
5/11/18,Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD & performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.
5/11/18,A cool thing about the design is that’s easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all
5/11/18,"Already started DC to NY route. 
Hopefully start LA to SF next year. That will be true @Hyperloop w pressurized pods in near vacuum tunnels & faster than jetliner."
5/11/18,First Boring Company tunnel under LA almost done! Pending final…  https://www.instagram.com/p/BinoVT6Acpd/?utm_source=ig_twitter_share …
5/11/18,"Towards end of next year. Btw, planning to launch Tesla in Turkey later this year. Love your country & will be there in person for the launch."
5/11/18,"This will work on entire S & X fleet, even first production units. Cool thing about software upgrades is that we can keep making your car better long after you bought it."
5/10/18,"All X & S will soon work with no key if your phone pairs w Bluetooth, signal strength is high & you enable feature"
5/10/18,"Yeah, we will add that as a feature"
5/10/18,!! Unnecessary characters. Will change.

5/4/18,New Roadster will have that
5/4/18,"Yes, definitely not"
5/4/18,It will be next level. These are really big numbers.
5/4/18,Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
5/4/18,Yup
5/4/18,"True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them."
5/4/18,"We went through the same drama on S & X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom."
5/4/18,"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising & no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0."
5/4/18,"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"
5/4/18,"The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors"
5/4/18,Exactly
5/4/18,"First, it’s important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market & has been for a while https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/11/tesla-is-the-biggest-short-in-the-us-stock-market.html …"
5/4/18,Please ignore this thread unless you’re interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock
5/4/18,They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
5/4/18,"Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S & X are producing major positive cash flow & Model 3 is about to do same."
5/4/18,"To be clear, I’m a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification"
5/4/18,"The “dry” questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them."

4/13/18,"Yes, excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated."
4/13/18,"The Economist used to be boring, but smart with a wicked dry wit. Now it’s just boring (sigh). Tesla will be profitable & cash flow+ in Q3 & Q4, so obv no need to raise money."
4/13/18,"Sorry, demand has been higher than expected. Making them as fast as possible, but waitlist is 3 to 6 months."

4/8/18,Upgraded SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pod speed test soon. Will try to reach half speed of sound (and brake) within ~1.2km.
4/8/18,Model 3 is the whole point. We only made the more expensive cars in order to make the mass-market car. We lacked the economies of scale and expertise to make it until now.

4/2/18,"Can’t believe you’re even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on what’s most critical, which is currently Model 3 production. Doug, who I regard as one of the world’s most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering."
4/2/18,"We release as soon as we have the data. Good timeline, bad timing. Doesn’t matter."
4/2/18,"Not criticizing, just as asking questions. I’m sure there’s a really great answer …"
4/2/18,"Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries & deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?"
4/2/18,"Seriously! Obviously, I’m not going to do an April Fool’s joke about going bankwupt if I thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh)."
4/2/18,"Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately & always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe."

3/25/18,Shocker
3/24/18,It’s not a political statement and I didn’t do this because someone dared me to do it. Just don’t like Facebook. Gives me the willies. Sorry.
3/24/18,I have just asked our team to slow down deliveries. It is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity due to batch build and delivery. Customer happiness & safety matter more than a few extra cars this quarter.
3/23/18,You’ll live
3/23/18,We’ve never advertised with FB. None of my companies buy advertising or pay famous people to fake endorse. Product lives or dies on its own merits.
3/23/18,"Instagram’s probably ok imo, so long as it stays fairly independent. I don’t use FB & never have, so don’t think I’m some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. Also, we don’t advertise or pay for endorsements, so … don’t care."
3/23/18,Ok
3/23/18,"What, a troll, me!? How dare you, sir!"
3/23/18,"Yeah, my fault for being an idiot. We did give them a free launch to make up for it and I think they had some insurance."
3/23/18,Definitely. Looks lame anyway.
3/23/18,First time I’ve seen either. One on the left looks official. Will be gone soon.
3/23/18,Maybe that word doesn’t mean what I think it does
3/23/18,Literally never seen it even once
3/23/18,"Yeah, it’s borderline. FB influence is slowly creeping in."
3/23/18,I didn’t realize there was one. Will do.

2/12/18,Found the source of the problem. The NASA database has the Falcon Block 1 performance. Version currently in production and set to fly in a few months is Block 5. SpaceX GNC team is submitting updated numbers.

2/12/18,"Under consideration. We’ve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing 2, flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be & will if BFR takes longer than expected."
2/12/18,"Side boosters landing on droneships & center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M."

2/12/18,Of course :)
2/12/18,"Maybe that plan works out, but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before 2023"
2/12/18,"That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high."
2/12/18,"Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not."
2/12/18,"The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy."

12/26/17,I promise that we will make a pickup truck right after Model Y. Have had the core design/engineering elements in my mind for almost 5 years. Am dying to build it.
12/26/17,"Sorry for the delay. We have the most advanced AI neural net of any consumer product by far, so it’s going through exhaustive testing. The results are blowing me away though and I think you will have a similar experience."
12/26/17,"Wanted again to send a note of deep gratitude to Tesla owners WW for taking a chance on a new company that all experts said would fail. 

So much blood, sweat & tears from the Tesla team went into creating cars that you’d truly love. I hope you do.

How can we improve further?"
12/25/17,"We will! At least, whatever is left over after we build the obelisks."
12/25/17,The circle is complete
12/24/17,Ok
12/24/17,"Hats sold out, flamethrowers soon!"

12/24/17,Yes
12/24/17,Having a sinking feeling that most people actually do think it was aliens …
12/23/17,"When you get the new Tesla software update, go Ho Ho Ho. There’s an Easter egg inside the Easter egg, but it’s not funny."
12/23/17,"46k limited edition boring hats sold, 4K to go. Then flamethrower."
12/23/17,I think last night might have been the biggest Rorschach test ever

12/21/17,"However, public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem, as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. Multi-level tunnels can solve this, but we need much better tunneling technology, as it is currently super slow and expensive."
12/21/17,"Major navigation overhaul coming in early 2018. Will be light-years ahead of current system, but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out."
12/21/17,"For the record, I actually love trains, most subways and London buses."
12/21/17,"Idiots can be very dangerous when they seem smart, but aren’t (having “PhD” in their bio is a dead giveaway), as some policymakers may get fooled. That’s what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit “expert”."
12/21/17,Glad to see that Tesla owners are having a good experience. Working to improve further. Some cool software updates coming soon. https://twitter.com/teslamotorsclub/status/943864830943006721 …

12/20/17,Max thrust at lift-off is 5.1 million pounds or 2300 metric tons. First mission will run at 92%.

9/4/17,Sorry about that. You're right. I was depressing myself too :(
9/4/17,"Govts don't need to follow normal laws. They will obtain AI developed by companies at gunpoint, if necessary."
9/4/17,Should be low on our list of concerns for civilizational existential risk. NK has no entangling alliances that wd polarize world into war.
9/4/17,"NK launching a nuclear missile would be suicide for their leadership, as SK, US and China wd invade and end the regime immediately"
9/4/17,"May be initiated not by the country leaders, but one of the AI's, if it decides that a prepemptive strike is most probable path to victory"

8/31/17,"Not a bad idea. For sure, it makes sense to test AI for safety in some kind of open world / sandbox virtual world."
8/31/17,In about six months or so. Linked to dual motor config.
8/31/17,We took the SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pusher pod for a spin by itself a few days ago to see what it…  https://www.instagram.com/p/BYckipugds5/ 
8/31/17,Tunnels are sealed to 5 atmospheres of water & gas pressure. Just need walls around the apertures.
8/30/17,"Not sure, but probably"
8/30/17,Feature coming soon
8/30/17,"They're so real. Anyone going to that much trouble must really care. I'd gladly follow their commands, but they're so friggin obtuse …"

8/28/17,"Not that this is remotely equiv to man on the moon, but there is a world of difference between talking about some random idea and doing it"

8/28/17,A tiny one
8/28/17,"Btw, high accel only needed because tube is short. For passenger transport, this can be spread over 20+ miles, so no spilt drinks."
8/28/17,"No such thing as true vacuum, so actually yes"

8/27/17,"Funny thing is, whenever I suggest all companies go to zero incentives, room gets very quiet. That's because others get a lot more than us."
8/27/17,Literally zero incentive laws were put into place by my companies. Zero. Others put them in place. Happy to go to zero incentives for all.
8/27/17,I'm not an investor. Just believe in putting money into my own companies. Don't think the OPM approach is right.
8/27/17,"The latter. There are pretty long gaps between each team run, so livestream is not the way to go."

8/25/17,Let me check on that for you. Found the answer right here: 🔥💩
8/25/17,It was misinterpreted by Rolfe at WSJ as a fundraising effort. Neuralink is not seeking investors.
8/25/17,WSJ has been laboriously negative for over a decade. I'm surprised they haven't bored their readers to death by now.
8/25/17,Neuralink is not raising money
8/25/17,"Max recovered booster velocity was Mach 7.9 (BulgarianSat). Energy is velocity squared, so this is a bigger difference than it appears"
8/25/17,"Max velocity: Mach 6.9
Max altitude: 247 km
Highest so far, but velocity matters much more"
8/25/17,Probably 2m or so
8/25/17,Exactly. Yeah.
8/25/17,Intentionally? Yes

8/19/17,Totally agree. This was a foolish oversight.
8/19/17,At some point. Features are prioritized by importance * number of owners likely to benefit.
8/19/17,Yeah. That's been on the future feature list for a while. Need to make sure rain sensor doesn't false positive or drain battery.
8/19/17,Will prob do something like that
8/19/17,Problem is possible impact on curbs or ground objects with the car itself or door swing arc
8/19/17,"Will do. Also, we need to make it a lot easier to adjust the headrest."
8/19/17,"Yeah, it should probably automatically adjust to the user config of whoever is closest to a given door when the handle is touched"

6/25/17,"True, but that's a minor factor for rockets"
6/25/17,"No, but shielding got fragged every flight. More control authority is for Falcon Heavy, but also enables Falcon 9 to land in heavier winds."
6/25/17,"They will, but the hydraulic system is closed loop, so no fluid lost. They do need more power & energy, but rocket has plenty of that."

6/9/17,Heard about it. Our experience doing projects with big car companies was not great. They move slowly & are reluctant to adopt new tech.

5/23/17,All Model S and X cars will have an auto raise and lower function for the steering wheel in a few months.
5/22/17,I spoke directly with The President three weeks ago about Paris. Many others have too. Cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.
5/22/17,Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic 360 deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.
5/22/17,"Early next year. To start with, we're making the simplest Model 3 first, like we did with S. Didn't do it with X, because I was an idiot."
5/22/17,We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.
5/22/17,"Can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian & cyclist safety"
5/22/17,Exactly
5/22/17,Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.
5/22/17,There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.
5/22/17,HW2. HW1 doesn't have enough sensors and computing power.
5/22/17,Hopefully June for those too
5/22/17,S for sure. It is a bigger car.
5/22/17,"I'd highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version 4). Only if you really want a smaller sedan, should you get a 3."
5/22/17,"Maybe I'm misinformed, but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that."
5/22/17,"Yeah, control algorithm is safe, but unpleasant. New one is even safer, but super smooth."
5/22/17,"Almost there, plus much improved web browser"
5/22/17,That will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in July
5/22/17,Almost there. Probably in a few months.
5/22/17,"You can easily turn it off in the car via settings, but that would beg the question of why you turned it off :)"
5/22/17,Something cool for sure
5/22/17,Excited about the Tesla Autopilot software release rolling out next month. New control algorithm feels as smooth as silk.
5/22/17,"Model 3, Model X & Model S will all have same level of Autopilot capability. It's just a matter of refining the vision & control software."
5/22/17,Wear underpants
5/22/17,Will do
5/22/17,Black and textured slate versions will be
5/21/17,Yes
5/19/17,"For reason I can't explain, I find #2 especially odd. Also, not a fan of #17. Has led too many people astray in valuing securities."

5/11/17,"First machine is Godot. Still waiting ... Don't know why, when or where."
5/11/17,Naming theme for tunnel boring machines will be poems & plays. Decided against plays & poems. Too obvious.
5/10/17,That's how the tiles sit on the roof. There is no difference in strength for the Tesla tile based on orientation (not like wood).
5/10/17,This is true. The economics are not yet compelling where housing and utility costs are low and property taxes are high.

4/1/17,"Def P100D with Ludicrous+, although the rocket starts going a lot faster after that"
3/31/17,We can def bring it back like Dragon. Just a question of how much weight we need to add.
3/31/17,Working on it
3/31/17,Looks like it could do 20% more with some structural upgrades to handle higher loads. But that's in fully expendable mode.
3/31/17,A lot

3/28/17,"Long Neuralink piece coming out on @waitbutwhy in about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time, but existential risk is too high not to."
3/24/17,We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster. You would get first in Norway.
3/24/17,Yes
3/24/17,Yes
3/24/17,I believe so
3/24/17,Yup
3/24/17,Oh so little faith
3/24/17,The shorter wheelbase only allows for a 75 kWh pack in Model 3 at current cell/module energy densities
3/24/17,Yeah
3/24/17,Start taking orders in April
3/24/17,"Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery."
3/24/17,"Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles …"
3/24/17,The Model S produced today is arguably version 4. Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model 3 arrives.
3/24/17,"If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week."
3/24/17,No problem :)
3/24/17,"Should be summer next year. Sorry, really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can."
3/24/17,Let me just go fetch my magic wand ...
3/24/17,"First in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it, which is probably in 6 to 9 months."
3/24/17,Damn straight we do! Coming with 8.1 next week.
3/24/17,First drive of a release candidate version of Model 3 pic.twitter.com/zcs6j1YRa4
3/24/17,It still has one display
3/24/17,Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.
3/24/17,"The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?"
3/24/17,How about the video we just took of the first Model 3 release candidate drive?
3/24/17,"Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!"
3/24/17,I think so
3/24/17,"No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S."
3/24/17,Tues/Wed
3/24/17,Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion
3/24/17,Tues/Wed next week
3/24/17,"Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away."
3/24/17,"Yes, but not until next year"
3/24/17,Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
3/24/17,"Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot"
3/24/17,How about now?
3/24/17,Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
3/24/17,All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
3/24/17,Definitely
3/24/17,"Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)"
3/24/17,Yes
3/24/17,"Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range & power & fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology."
3/24/17,"Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the ""next version"" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true."
3/24/17,Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!
3/24/17,"I used to be one. You're welcome. Trying my best, at least. Hope it's a bit useful."
3/24/17,Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien
3/24/17,The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one. I'm being optimistic.
3/24/17,"Probably. Either that, simulation, great filter or they are very, very subtle."
3/24/17,I hope that didn't work

3/22/17,Except that isn't actually my house ...
3/22/17,"Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars, but this is not it."
3/22/17,I am not. This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing. Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.
3/16/17,"3 is a great car, but definitely Model S"
3/14/17,Good point

3/12/17,"Looking forward to it. I know it's cliche, but LotR is my favorite book ever :) Want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater NZ."
3/12/17,"Sure. Just check out my prior tweet on pricing ($250 kWh at pack level). Website will be updated soon, so there is complete transparency."
3/12/17,"Can only happen with your support, and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches"
3/12/17,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan, especially @mcannonbrookes"
3/12/17,I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.
3/12/17,"Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter, which kinda ""digitizes"" DC power"
3/12/17,High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-voltage_direct_current …
3/12/17,"Ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power & electronics both DC."
3/12/17,You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC. https://twitter.com/turnbullmalcolm/status/840763614856339456 …
3/11/17,"Just spoke with @JayWeatherill, Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution."
3/10/17,"Yes, but shipping, taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control"
3/10/17,$250/kWh at the pack level for 100MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
3/10/17,Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?

2/18/17,System was green for launch. I called it off.
2/18/17,"They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&D risk on Dragon 2, that I feel very confident of 2018."
2/18/17,"Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed"
2/18/17,"Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day."
2/18/17,"Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question"
2/18/17,"If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause"
2/18/17,"All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate."

2/7/17,"yes, altitude improves performance for electric. Opposite of combustion cars."
2/7/17,"No, will be lower. Wheelbase can't fit 100."
2/7/17,"Also, Tesla service can remove front trunk liner if you don't use it and improve performance further"
2/7/17,"No plans to take X, S (or 3) above 100 kWh. Semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go above."
2/7/17,Take out the floor mats and its 2.27. MT said everything had to be standard production.
2/7/17,yes
2/7/17,Production Tesla Model S P100DL sets Motor Trend all-time world record to 60 mph in 2.27 sec http://bit.ly/2kmMo3m 
2/5/17,Signing off now. That was more than enough Twitter trouble for one morning!
2/5/17,No rare earth metals in battery
2/5/17,Almost ready
2/5/17,App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.
2/5/17,"Yes, but Model 3 is the overwhelming priority"
2/5/17,I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
2/5/17,Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
2/5/17,A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
2/5/17,"Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in 140 chars and tone is lost in text"
2/5/17,People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.
2/5/17,Rolling out a new update today.
2/5/17,We should try our best
2/5/17,"Really? Ok, I will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. Sorry for anything thoughtless."
2/5/17,I just had three coffees :)
2/5/17,Mars is critical for the long-term survival of humanity and life on Earth as we know it

2/5/17,Me too. I hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon ...
2/5/17,"I agree, great country! Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. I've heard it is incredibly beautiful."
2/5/17,True. Me being one of them :)
2/5/17,"Not perfect & cd be better, but 10th out of 200+ countries with only a 0.08 diff to ""1st"" place means it's essentially on par"
2/5/17,"Fair point, sorry"
2/5/17,"Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?"
2/5/17,Exactly
2/5/17,Norway is great on all levels. Love Norway!
2/5/17,Yeah. And Twitter is a hater Hellscape.
2/5/17,"Good grief, I'm not ""working"" for Trump. I'm trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction."
2/5/17,"Actually, I think it's kinda cool :)"
2/5/17,Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
2/5/17,"Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors."
2/5/17,Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
2/5/17,You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
2/5/17,Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
2/5/17,Mostly anti-drug laws
2/5/17,Exactly
2/5/17,"The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law."
2/5/17,The remedy for that is changing the law
2/5/17,"Ok, but what's up the wigs?"
2/5/17,There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
2/5/17,True!
2/5/17,"Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served."
2/4/17,Walking down the street and saw this pic.twitter.com/Mpv5j6088K
2/4/17,I wish!
2/4/17,"Then so be it. I'd rather do what I believe is right, than do what appears right simply to avoid criticism."
2/4/17,"Wow, cool!"
2/4/17,That's exactly what I thought. Love Half-Life.
2/4/17,Nuances are important :)

2/4/17,Really don't want to get in politics. I just want to help invent and develop technologies that improve lives. Feels so bizarre.
2/4/17,"Yes, for now, but this should be addressed on all fronts: judicial, legislative and executive."
2/4/17,"In addition, I again raised climate. I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council & keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong."
2/4/17,"At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost"

2/4/17,There has already been and there will be progress on this matter
2/3/17,Regarding the meeting at the White House: pic.twitter.com/8b1XH4oW6h
2/2/17,yes
1/31/17,Headline & article is misleading. I said it won't be retracted (ie withdrawn by Pres). It may be revoked by judicial or legislative means.

1/30/17,"Yeah, sorry about that :)"
1/30/17,"Yes, the order is still bad, but it is always important to read the source material"

1/29/17,"Exactly. There is no possibility of retraction, but there is possibility of modification. It's just a non-zero possibility. Don't know more."
1/29/17,Please read immigration order. Lmk specific amendments. Will seek advisory council consensus & present to President. http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2017/01/27/text-of-trump-executive-order-on-barring-refugees/ …
1/29/17,It is not
1/29/17,"Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They've done right,not wrong & don't deserve to be rejected."
1/29/17,The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country’s challenges
1/28/17,"This is silly. If adding lanes actually did make it worse, that would imply removing lanes makes it better. Obv not true."

1/27/17,"Yeah, am hearing this from a lot of people & it's getting me down. I'm just trying to make a positive contribution & hope good comes of it."
1/25/17,"Earthquakes tend to have the biggest effect on the surface, like waves on water. That's why LA can have a (lame, but getting better) subway."
1/25/17,"Starting across from my desk at SpaceX. Crenshaw and the 105 Freeway, which is 5 mins from LAX"
1/25/17,Yup
1/25/17,Maybe next month
1/25/17,Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so.

1/25/17,I'm just saying that we should see what happens first. The actions may be surprising.
1/25/17,No they don't
1/25/17,Was wondering what those were
1/25/17,Sigh
1/25/17,That may be a difficult award to decline
1/25/17,"Tillerson also said that “the risk of climate change does exist” and he believed “action should be taken"""
1/25/17,"... on how to address threats of climate change. They do require a global response."""
1/25/17,"Tillerson at his confirmation hearing: ""I think it’s important that the United States maintain its seat at the table in the conversation ..."
1/24/17,"Ok, fine. Soldier 76. My dark secret is out ..."
1/24/17,I share The Economist's opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise
1/24/17,"Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA."
1/24/17,"This may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State."
1/24/17,There will be a software update this weekend that improves self-calibration ability
1/24/17,"3 months maybe, 6 months definitely"
1/23/17,"Yes, safety should improve significantly due to autonomy features, even if regs disallow no driver present"
1/22/17,"Auto steer limited to 45 mph on highways for now, i.e. heavy traffic, where it is needed most. Limit will raise as we get more data."
1/22/17,Autonomy capability should improve via OTA every 2 to 6 weeks
1/22/17,For now
1/22/17,"The 100D price takes into account exchange rate shifts, whereas other vehicle prices haven't yet been adjusted"
1/22/17,Yes. Block 5 is the final upgrade of the Falcon architecture. Significantly improves performance & ease of reusability. Flies end of year.
1/22/17,"If we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of innovation would drop dramatically"
1/22/17,Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major revs every 12 to 18 months.
1/22/17,Yes
1/21/17,"Unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing 300+ parts. Wish there was an easy way."

1/21/17,Validating a GPU driver fix and camera pitch angle health check for HW2
1/19/17,"Similar to SpaceX, the T is like a cross section of an electric motor, just as the X is like a rocket trajectory"
1/19/17,Our target is a 90% reduction with HW2 as the software matures
1/19/17,"Not specifically, but there have been several incidences of pedestrian and bicyclist lives saved by Autopilot"
1/19/17,It might. Am not sure.
1/19/17,Looking good so far. Should roll out this weekend.
1/19/17,Report highlight: “The data show that the Tesla vehicles crash rate dropped by almost 40 percent after Autosteer installation.”

1/12/17,Sarah should be in contact with you soon about doing a benchmark test
1/12/17,It is
1/12/17,"Hopefully, early next week. Results from limited release look good so far. Trying our best to be super careful."
1/12/17,"Good point. 2.34 would be a production Tesla. Stripped down, maybe as low as 2.1."
1/12/17,It will
1/12/17,Promising early results from the Ludricrous Easter egg. Looks like 0 to 60 mph in 2.34 sec (Motor Trend spec) might be achievable...
1/12/17,"If the results look good from the latest point release, then we are days away from a release to all HW1 and to all HW2 early next week"
1/11/17,The least cool characters...it's embarrassing
1/11/17,It will in an upcoming release later this year
1/11/17,Tesla's approach to building an autonomy platform is focused on high compute efficiency machine learning. Primarily vision w radar & sonar.
1/10/17,Increasing capacity at existing Supercharger locations now has top priority. Some are overflowing while a nearby one is empty.
1/8/17,"Longitudinal control will, but lateral (steering) control will cap at 35 mph for a bit longer. Will raise after full fleet data rolls in."
1/8/17,"If all looks good, HW2 Autopilot functionality will switch from shadow to active mode by end of week for cars beyond initial 1000"
1/8/17,New rev for Autopilot HW2 rolling out Mon to first 1000 & to rest of fleet in shadow mode. Also improves HW1 and enables Ludicrous+.

12/24/16,Brain is full right now and that's a hard one
12/24/16,"There are some installed already, but full rollout really needs Supercharger V3 and Powerpack V2, plus SolarCity. Pieces now in place."
12/24/16,"If you don't like the P100DL, you can give it back"
12/24/16,Good idea

9/21/16,My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.

7/16/16,yes
7/16/16,good up to ~160km/h
7/16/16,Our radar is using a wavelength of 3.9mm. A good size for both decent resolution and rain penetration. Am hopeful...

7/10/16,Blog on Autopilot by @PeterDiamandis  http://diamandis.com/tech-blog 
7/10/16,US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is 17 deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
7/10/16,Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before 1B.
7/10/16,"It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience."
7/10/16,"With less than 1B miles, there simply isn't enough data. 1B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition."
7/10/16,"Thanks. Point of calling it ""beta"" was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect."
7/10/16,exactly
7/10/16,"that wasn't criticism, just clarification"
7/10/16,why?
7/10/16,thought I was posting Reuters. Copied the wrong link.
7/10/16,Probably six months. Will include hundreds of refinements to handle rare corner cases in Autopilot.
7/10/16,"you're right, no point"

6/15/16,Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
6/15/16,Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
6/15/16,Quite rapid... Yes
6/15/16,RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly :)
6/15/16,Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.

5/27/16,Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).

4/3/16,@B_Rans yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
4/3/16,@gerardomarina Some tweaking underway
4/3/16,@HBL_Cosmin Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.
4/3/16,@MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.

1/17/16,"If speed at stage separation > ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
1/17/16,Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site

1/17/16,"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
1/17/16,"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating & rotating."

3/12/15,"Seems like an opportune moment to bring up the Fermi Paradox, aka ""where are the aliens?"" Really odd that we see no sign of them."

3/8/15,"There is no slowdown of the Gigafactory construction underway, as anyone near Reno with eyes can verify. It's not subtle."
3/7/15,Some shots of the Gigafactory pilot plant (~20% of full size) under construction https://m.flickr.com/#/photos/jurvetson/16735645181/ …
3/2/15,"Upgrades in the works to allow landing for geo missions: thrust +15%, deep cryo oxygen, upper stage tank vol +10%"
3/2/15,Both satellites deployed on target. Now firing their ion thrusters to reach geo station over Europe & Asia.
3/2/15,Next landing attempt will be 3rd launch from now. Tonight's flight and following one will not have enough propellant.
2/26/15,Excellent and funny intro article about Artificial Superintelligence! Highly recommend reading http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html …

2/11/15,Rocket soft landed in the ocean within 10m of target & nicely vertical! High probability of good droneship landing in non-stormy weather.
2/11/15,Primary mission on target. Spacecraft head towards the sun! All good there.
2/11/15,@DanielLockyer We could actually do that...maybe we should
2/11/15,Planning a significant upgrade of the droneship for future missions to handle literally anything. Maybe give it a Merlin for good measure :)
2/11/15,Can't delay any longer. Must proceed with primary mission to launch the Deep Space Climate Observatory spacecraft.
2/11/15,"Mega storm preventing droneship from remaining on station, so rocket will try to land on water. Survival probability <1%."

2/10/15,"Launch postponed to tomorrow due to high winds at the Cape, but Dragon still inbound from orbit in 90 mins"
2/10/15,Extreme wind shear over Cape Canaveral. Feels like a sledgehammer when supersonic in the vertical. Hoping it changes …

2/8/15,"Prob good though. Will give us time to replace 1st stage video transmitter (not needed for launch, but nice to have)."
2/8/15,Air Force tracking radar went down. Launch postponed to same time tomorrow.
2/8/15,Rocket reentry will be much tougher this time around due to deep space mission. Almost 2X force and 4X heat. Plenty of hydraulic fluid tho.
2/8/15,"Launching our 1st deep space mission today. Headed to Earth-Sun L1 gravity null point at 1M miles, 4X further than moon."
